An unfortunate aspect of the internet is that most of it is **glamorized**. Rarely showing the **reality** of what's going on behind the scenes. Nothing depicts this better than those "Day In the Life" videos of a software engineer.

I'm Asiqur Rahman, a Software Engineer at Cod√©dex, and today I'll be showing you a real day in the life of a software engineer building a startup, who also happens to be a college dropout, and is also on a weight loss grind.

#### 8:20 - 8:45 AM

Starting off the day at 8:15 AM, waking up. That gives me 30 minutes to be out the door by 8:45 AM to catch the train that leaves at 8:53 AM. I setup two types of alarm, one alarm on [Amazon Echo](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tXORv8LAL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg) and 10 alarms on my phone spaced out every 5 minutes.

Soo...I'm not really deciplined in waking up on time. I just brute force it.

#### 8:55 - 9:45 AM

Since I live in Jersey City and our office is in Dumbo, Brooklyn, I'll have to make 3 transfers. First is the [Lightrail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/HBLR_Jersey_City_July_2013.jpg), followed by the [Path](https://www.trains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TRN_PATH_Exchange_Place.jpg), and finally the [A Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) dropping me off in Dumbo, Brooklyn.

Where I'll grab a black coffee from [Joe's](https://joecoffeecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8426-960x1440.jpg) right before heading into the office. Black coffee, which has less than 5 calories and is great for weight loss. More on this later!

#### 10:00 - 12:00 PM

Meetings, meetings, meetings üòµ‚Äçüí´

For the next 2 hours, I'll be in meetings, dealing with different areas of the team.

- **Daily standup (10 - 10:30 AM)**

  Everyone saying "Good on my end" and moving on...jk. This meeting is mainly about bringing up any blockers and resolving them. This one can move pretty fast, sometimes ending in less than 10 minutes.

- **Curriculum meeting (10:30 - 11:00 AM)**

  On this particular day, we were discussing the next course to start on, which ended up being Node.js (Dropping Soon üëÄ).

- **Technical Content Sync (11:30 - 12:00 PM)**

  A meeting with Naomi, our Social Media Manager, on how we can bring more technical content to our social platforms. The ideas brainstormed in this meeting did end up being scrapped due to other big [social plans](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE8GqROvtCF/).

#### 12:00 - 2:00 PM

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GvgVoSu.jpeg" height="300" />

The team headed out for lunch while I decided to stay back, mainly because, as an engineer, I haven't gotten real engineering work done yet üíÄ due to those meetings. I wanted to use this time to get some smaller items done so I can focus on some bigger projects later on.

One of those smaller items dealt with decreasing the load times of our Challenge Packs. Sometimes they would take 5 seconds to load, which was really bad UX. So some refactoring was done, and the speed was drastically improved. Below is the before and after.

</div>

When the team came back, they brought me back a coffee and yogurt, which I estimated to be 300 calories, bringing my calorie intake so far to 305, including the morning coffee.

#### 2:00 - 3:00 PM

The final meeting of the day was a product meeting. Discussing our roadmap for Q1 2025, what to prioritize, when to ship, etc.

Some of those items included the dedicated [Worlds](https://www.codedex.io/worlds) page, new Notification system, revamped [Community](https://www.codedex.io/community), and other things that I can't talk about just yet. You can see everything that we shipped for January in the [changelog](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-update-january-2025).

#### 3:00 - 7:00 PM

The rest of the day consists of getting some deep work done, removing any blockers for myself or other teammates, shooting some content for our socials, and calling it a day around 7 PM.

#### 7:00 - 9:30 PM

Heading back home is an hour ride where I just spam Juice WRLD on repeat. By the time I'm home, it's 8 PM, and I'll spend the next hour and a half decompressing and getting something to eat.

Which was a yogurt bowl:

- 170g non-fat yogurt (90 cals)
- 1 scoop Whey protein (110 cals)
- 30g of Almonds (200 cals)

Totaling my daily calorie intake to 845 calories. Which is all I'll have for the day. A bit more on this below.

#### 9:30 - 11:00 PM

GYM TIME üí™üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Because I'm on a weight loss journey, I try to exercise 4-5 times a week for at least 90 minutes. Which I split into two sections. 45 minutes of cardio, treadmill, and stair masters. 45 minutes of weights. For the weights, I honestly don't know what each of the exercises is called lol. But I try to do 4-6 variations with the dumbbells and machines.

With this routine and 700 calorie a day restriction, I managed to lose nearly 100 pounds over the course of a year. Obviously, I'm not perfect every day, but I try to stick to it and make up for it the next day if I miss a gym session or go over my calorie restriction. You can read more about it in this [post](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/submission/lk14Qr20Ze4fzyGeSbpW).

#### 11:00 - 12:30 AM

Heading back home, showering, and doom scrolling Twitter for 20 minutes.

#### 12:30 - 3:00 AM

Because this is a startup, the grind truly never ends. For every successful startup you see, there are a hundred others that never made it.

And to prevent Cod√©dex from being one of those, it means putting in relentless effort even when it seems unnecessary. Like putting in hours past 12 AM. Whether to get out a feature one day early into the hands of users or fixing a bug that less than 1% of users will notice. Everything matters.

During these hours, I'll be working on the foundations for the next big project, fixing bugs, or just prepping docs for the next day's meetings. It varies from day to day. I usually try to call it around 2 AM, but it ends up being 3 AM, and some days even 5 AM.

But yeah, that's the day in the life of an SWE building a startup, office edition. The next one might be the a -home edition, which I will most likely post in the [OPC](https://www.codedex.io/community), so feel free to follow me there!
