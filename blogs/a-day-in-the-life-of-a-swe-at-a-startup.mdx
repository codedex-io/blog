An unfortanate aspect of the internet is that most of it is **glamorize**. Rarely showing the **reality** of whats going on behind the scenes. Nothing depicts this better then those "Day In the Life Videos" of a software engineers.

Hi all, I'm Asiqur Rahman a Software Engineer at Cod√©dex and today I'll be showing you a real day in the life of a software engineer at a startup, who also happens to be a college dropout, and also happens to be on a weight loss grind.

## 8:20 - 8:45 AM

Starting off the day is at 8:15 AM, waking up. That gives me 30 minutes to be out the door by 8:45 AM to catch the train that leaves at 8:53 AM. The night before I decide what'll be wearing so that I waste no time in the morning.

## 8:55 - 9:45 AM

I'm on the train and since I live in Jersey City and our office is in Dumbo Brooklyn, I'll be having to make 3 transfers. First is the [Lightrail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/HBLR_Jersey_City_July_2013.jpg), followed by the [Path](https://www.trains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TRN_PATH_Exchange_Place.jpg) and finally the [A Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) dropping me off at Dumbo brooklyn.
WHere I'll grab a black coffee from (Joe's)[https://joecoffeecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8426-960x1440.jpg] right before heading into the office. Black coffee, which has less then 5 calores and is great for weight less. More on this later!

## 10:00 - 12:00 AM

Meetings galore üòµ‚Äçüí´

For the next 2 hours I'll be in meetings, dealing with differeant areas of the team.

- Daily standup (10 - 10:30)
  Everyone saying "Good on my end" and moving on...jk. This meeting is mainly bringing up any blockers and resolving them ASAP . This one can move pretty fast sometimes ending in less then 10 minutes.
- Curriculum meeting (10:30 - 11:00 AM)
  Talking about content production, what and when to work on next, etc. On this particular day we were discussing the next course to start on, which happened to be Node.js (Dropping Soon üëÄ).
- Technical Content Sync (11:30 - 12:00 PM)
  A meeting with Naomi our Social media manager on how we can bring more technical content on our social platforms. The ideas brainstormed in this meeting did end up being scrapped due to other big [social plans](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE8GqROvtCF/).

## 12:00 - 1:30 PM

The team headed out for lunch while I decided to stay back, mainly because because being en engineer I havent gotten real eng work done yet üíÄ due to those meetings. But I wanted to use this time to get some while smaller items done so I can focus on some bigger items later on.

One of those smaller items dealt with increasing the load times of our Challenge Packs. Some times they would take 5 seconds to load which was really bad UX. So I did some refactoring and drastically increaed the speed. Below is the before and after

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem" }}>
  <Button varient="subtle">Before</Button>
  <Button>After</Button>
</div>
