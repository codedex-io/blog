An unfortunate aspect of the internet is that most of it is glamorized. Rarely showing the reality of what's going on behind the scenes. Nothing depicts this better than those "Day In the Life" videos of a software engineer.

I’m Asiqur, a college dropout turned Software Engineer at Codédex, and today, I’m giving you an unfiltered look at what my day-to-day actually looks like — building a tech startup while grinding toward my weight loss goals in the big apple.

Let's get into it.

#### 8:15 - 8:45 AM: Bzzzz Bzzzz Bzzzz

Starting off the day at 8:15 AM, waking up. 🤤

That gives me a solid 30 minutes to be out the door to catch the 8:53 AM train. 

To make sure I wake up, I set two types of alarms: one on my [Amazon Echo](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tXORv8LAL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg) and ten on my phone, spaced five minutes apart. Soo... I'm not really disciplined when it comes to waking up on time. I just brute force it. ⏰

#### 8:55 - 9:45 AM: Morning Commute

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/D51auVy.png" />

Since I live in Jersey City and the Codédex office is in DUMBO, Brooklyn, my commute (50 min) requires three transfers: 

1. [Lightrail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/HBLR_Jersey_City_July_2013.jpg) 🚎
2. [PATH](https://www.trains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TRN_PATH_Exchange_Place.jpg) 🚃
3. [A Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) 🚈

I’ll grab a black coffee from [Joe's Coffee](https://joecoffeecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8426-960x1440.jpg) before heading into the office. Black coffee, which has less than 5 calories and is great for weight loss. More on that later! ☕️

#### 10:00 - 12:00 PM: Meetings, Meetings, Meetings

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N3zzbAp.png" />

For the next two hours, I'm in meetings, dealing with different areas of the team.

- **Daily Standup (30 min)**

  Everyone saying, "Good on my end," and moving on... jk. This meeting is mainly about surfacing blockers and resolving them. It moves pretty fast, sometimes wrapping up in under 15 minutes.

- **Curriculum Bi-Weekly (30 min)**

  Today's focus: deciding on our next course. The winner? **Node.js** (dropping soon 👀). I'm on the Eng team, but I sit in Curriculum team's meetings since we're a small team.

- **Technical Content Sync (30 min)**

  A strategy session with Naomi, our Marketing Lead, on bringing more technical content to our social platforms. Spoiler: the ideas we brainstormed got scrapped in favor of some bigger [social plans](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE8GqROvtCF/).

#### 12:00 - 2:00 PM

The team headed out for lunch while I decided to stay back, mainly because, as an engineer, I haven't gotten real engineering work done yet 💀 due to those meetings. I wanted to use this time to get some smaller items done so I can focus on some bigger projects later on.

One of those smaller items dealt with decreasing the load times of our Challenge Packs. Sometimes they would take 5 seconds to load, which was really bad UX. So some refactoring was done, and the speed was drastically improved. Below is the before and after.

When the team came back, they brought me back a coffee and yogurt, which I estimated to be 300 calories, bringing my calorie intake so far to 305, including the morning coffee.

#### 2:00 - 3:00 PM

The final meeting of the day was a product meeting. Discussing our roadmap for Q1 2025, what to prioritize, when to ship, etc.

Some of those items included the dedicated [Worlds](https://www.codedex.io/worlds) page, new Notification system, revamped [Community](https://www.codedex.io/community), and other things that I can't talk about just yet. You can see everything that we shipped for January in the [changelog](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-update-january-2025).

#### 3:00 - 7:00 PM

The rest of the day consists of getting some deep work done, removing any blockers for myself or other teammates, shooting some content for our socials, and calling it a day around 7 PM.

#### 7:00 - 9:30 PM

Heading back home is an hour ride where I just spam Juice WRLD on repeat. By the time I'm home, it's 8 PM, and I'll spend the next hour and a half decompressing and getting something to eat.

Which was a yogurt bowl:

- 170g non-fat yogurt (90 cals)
- 1 scoop Whey protein (110 cals)
- 30g of Almonds (200 cals)

Totaling my daily calorie intake to 845 calories. Which is all I'll have for the day. A bit more on this below.

#### 9:30 - 11:00 PM

GYM TIME 💪🏋️‍♂️

Because I'm on a weight loss journey, I try to exercise 4-5 times a week for at least 90 minutes. Which I split into two sections. 45 minutes of cardio, treadmill, and stair masters. 45 minutes of weights. For the weights, I honestly don't know what each of the exercises is called lol. But I try to do 4-6 variations with the dumbbells and machines.

With this routine and 700 calorie a day restriction, I managed to lose nearly 100 pounds over the course of a year. Obviously, I'm not perfect every day, but I try to stick to it and make up for it the next day if I miss a gym session or go over my calorie restriction. You can read more about it in this [post](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/submission/lk14Qr20Ze4fzyGeSbpW).

#### 11:00 - 12:30 AM

Heading back home, showering, and doomscrolling Twitter for 20 minutes. So far, some of y'all might think that I don't have a life outside of work. While that is mostly true 😅, it's not as bad as it seems, mainly because all of this is a game to me.

What do I mean by this? By nature, I'm a very competitive person. Whatever I get into, I aim to be the best at. Whether that's becoming valedictorian (before my dropout phase 😂), reaching the top 30 in Overwatch, or now, the startup life. Startups represent the peak of competitiveness. Every single day, you're competing to be better than everyone else and better than the day before. 

Each new thing we accomplish is like a checkpoint in a game for me. Whether that's releasing a new product feature, completing [pre-seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_round#:~:text=A%20pre%2Dseed%20or%20angel,discover%20initial%20product%2Dmarket%20fit.), or just surviving another day. Each one of these is a dopamine hit, and in a startup environment, there's always a next checkpoint. So from my point of view, I'm just a addict playing an endless game.

#### 12:30 - 3:00 AM

Because this is a startup, the grind truly never ends. For every successful startup you see, there are a hundred others that never made it.

And to prevent Codédex from being one of those, it means putting in relentless effort even when it seems unnecessary. Like putting in hours past 12 AM. Whether to get out a feature one day early into the hands of users or fixing a bug that less than 1% of users will notice. Everything matters.

During these hours, I'll be working on the foundations for the next big project, fixing bugs, or just prepping docs for the next day's meetings. It varies from day to day. I usually try to call it around 2 AM, but it ends up being 3 AM, and some days even 5 AM.

But yeah, that's the day in the life of an SWE building a startup, office edition. The next one might be the at home edition, which I will most likely post in the [OPC](https://www.codedex.io/community), so feel free to follow me there!
