An unfortanate aspect of the internet is that most of it is **glamorized**. Rarely showing the **reality** of whats going on behind the scenes. Nothing depicts this better then those "Day In the Life Videos" of a software engineers.

Hi all, I'm Asiqur Rahman a Software Engineer at Cod√©dex and today I'll be showing you a real day in the life of a software engineer at a startup, who also happens to be a college dropout, and also happens to be on a weight loss grind.

### 8:20 - 8:45 AM

Starting off the day is at 8:15 AM, waking up. That gives me 30 minutes to be out the door by 8:45 AM to catch the train that leaves at 8:53 AM.

### 8:55 - 9:45 AM

Since I live in Jersey City and our office is in Dumbo Brooklyn, I'll have to make 3 transfers. First is the [Lightrail](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/HBLR_Jersey_City_July_2013.jpg), followed by the [Path](https://www.trains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TRN_PATH_Exchange_Place.jpg) and finally the [A Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) dropping me off at Dumbo brooklyn.

Where I'll grab a black coffee from [Joe's](https://joecoffeecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_8426-960x1440.jpg) right before heading into the office. Black coffee, which has less then 5 calores and is great for weight less. More on this later!

### 10:00 - 12:00 AM

Meetings Meetings Meetings üòµ‚Äçüí´

For the next 2 hours I'll be in meetings, dealing with differeant areas of the team.

- **Daily standup (10 - 10:30)**

  Everyone saying "Good on my end" and moving on...jk. This meeting is mainly bringing up any blockers and resolving them. This one can move pretty fast, sometimes ending in less then 10 minutes.

- **Curriculum meeting (10:30 - 11:00 AM)**

  On this particular day we were discussing the next course to start on, which end up being Node.js (Dropping Soon üëÄ).

- **Technical Content Sync (11:30 - 12:00 PM)**

  A meeting with Naomi our Social media manager on how we can bring more technical content to our social platforms. The ideas brainstormed in this meeting did end up being scrapped due to other big [social plans](https://www.instagram.com/p/DE8GqROvtCF/).

### 12:00 - 2:00 PM

The team headed out for lunch while I decided to stay back, mainly because because being en engineer I havent gotten real eng work done yet üíÄ due to those meetings. I wanted to use this time to get some smaller items done so I can focus on some bigger projects later on.

One of those smaller items dealt with decreasing the load times of our Challenge Packs. Some times they would take 5 seconds to load which was really bad UX. So some refactoring was done and the speed was drastically improved. Below is the before and after.

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: ".5rem" }}>

</div>

When the team came back, they brought me back a coffee and Yogurt which I estimated to be 300 calories, bringing my calorie intake so far to 305, including the morning coffee.

### 2:00 - 3:00 PM

Final meeting of the day was a product meeting. Discussing our roadmap for Q1 2025, what to prioritize, when to ship, etc.
Some of those items included the dedicated [Worlds](https://www.codedex.io/worlds) page, new Notification system, revamped [Community](https://www.codedex.io/community) and other things that I cant talk about just yet. You can see everything that we shipped for January in the [changelog](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-update-january-2025).

### 3:00 - 7:00 PM

The rest of the day consists of getting some deep work done, getting another coffee at 4:30 PM, shooting some content for our socals and calling it a day around 7 PM.


### 7:00 - 9:00 PM

Heading back home is a hour ride where I just spam Juice World on repeat. By the time I'm home it's 8:
