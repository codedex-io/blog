Hey, Dharma here! Bringing a new update from the Codédex team. 

Let’s talk pricing. 💸

#### Accessibility Is More Than Just UI

At Codédex, we often talk about accessibility in terms of UI/UX design – font size, color contrast, and responsive layouts. But there’s another kind of accessibility that’s just as important: **financial accessibility**.

We’re on a mission to provide the best tech education in the world and make it universally available – no matter your background or where you live. Since launch, over 500,000 learners across 192 countries have joined our platform.

[Codédex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing), our premium subscription, is $12.99/month.

In 2024, we introduced a discount based on pricing parity for six countries: 🇮🇳 India, 🇲🇽 Mexico, 🇨🇴 Colombia, 🇦🇷 Argentina, 🇮🇩 Indonesia, and 🇵🇭 Philippines.

And now, three more countries are joining the list: 🇧🇷 Brazil, 🇨🇱 Chile, and 🇻🇳 Vietnam. 

If you’re in one of these nine countries, you’ll now see discounted prices for Codédex Club, tailored to your local economy:

| Country          | Tier        | Monthly Price       | Annual Price      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 🇮🇳 India       | 3 (75% off) | ₹279 ($3.25)        | ₹2049 ($24)       |
| 🇲🇽 Mexico      | 2 (50% off) | MX$130 ($6.50)      | MX$960 ($48)      |
| 🇨🇴 Colombia    | 2 (50% off) | COP$26,930 ($6.50)  | COP$198,817 ($48) |
| 🇦🇷 Argentina   | 3 (50% off) | ARS$6,999 ($6.50)   | ARS$51,449 ($48)  |
| 🇮🇩 Indonesia   | 3 (50% off) | IDR 107,640 ($6.50) | IDR 794,880 ($48) |
| 🇵🇭 Philippines | 2 (50% off) | PHP 370 ($6.50)     | PHP 2,760 ($48)   |
| 🇧🇷 Brazil      | 3 (50% off) | R$37 ($6.50)        | R$270 ($48)       |
| 🇻🇳 Vietnam     | 3 (75% off) | VND 83,297 ($3.25)  | VND 615,118 ($24) |
| 🇨🇱 Chile       | 2 (50% off) | CLP$6,000 ($6.50)   | CLP$44,330 ($48)  |

These countries are all in our top 20 by user base. We determined these price points using World Bank data, specifically Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, adjusted for PPP, and by discussing with our users.

Prices update automatically based on your location. If you’re using a VPN, traveling, or something doesn’t look right, just email us at help@codedex.io.

#### Why This Matters

As a small startup, we’re constantly making tough decisions about what to build next. But one thing we’ve never compromised on is supporting our community. From being part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack to running Monthly Challenges and more – we’re here for you.

Codédex has brought together an incredible global community of technologists – high schoolers, college students, career switchers, and vibe coders alike. We want everyone to be able to level up and build cool stuff, without pricing getting in the way.

This is just one step toward that vision. 💛

#### What’s Next?

We’re still figuring this out. Localization is tricky, exchange rates fluctuate, and no pricing model is perfect. But our goal is clear: make Codédex more accessible for everyone.

More to come soon! Until then...

Happy coding,
Dharma
