Hello CS students, **Harvard WECode 2024** is happening this weekend (February 17-18) and Codédex is sponsoring the event! 

#### What the heck is WECode?

[WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com) is the world’s largest student-run women in tech conference. It’s a two-day event packed full of panel talks, fireside chats, and workshops. Over a thousand students from 300+ universities are attending – this is a perfect opportunity to meet fellow techies from other schools.

This year, Codédex team members [Katherin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherin-s-29970a124), [Naomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomixlee), and [Sonny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonnynomnom) are traveling to Cambridge, MA to attend! Yayyy! 🚌💨

This will be the third stop of our February Campus Tour:

- ⛳️ TartanHacks (Pittsburgh, PA) on Feb 3* 
- ⛳️ SBUHacks (Stony Brook, NY) on Feb 10 
- ⛳️ WECode (Cambridge, MA) on Feb 17-18 🌟

#### How to find us?

We’ll be filming on-the-street style interview videos, passing out limited edition merch on Sunday (February 18), and chatting with everyone!

There will also be a **Codédex booth at the Career Fair (Sunday @ 3-5 pm)**, where you'll get to meet the team, grab free stickers, learn all about Codédex, and for a chance to be in our new ✨ Codédex Creator Program ✨.

See you this weekend!
