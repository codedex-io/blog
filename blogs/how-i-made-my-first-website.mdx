Hi, I’m [Sophie](https://www.codedex.io/@MarSianer) – a total newbie in the world of web development, who couldn’t write a single line of code just one month ago. 😆

Recently, I built my very first website and shared it with the [Codédex community](https://codedex.io/community). People LIKED it so much that the Codédex team even invited me to write about my journey of creating this cute little website! Yay! 🥳

So in this blog post, I’ll take you behind the scenes of how I built my very first website from scratch – the exact tools and resources I used, the step-by-step process I followed, and the challenges I ran into and how I actually overcame them. If you’ve ever wanted to create your own little corner of the internet but didn’t know where to start, this one’s for you. ✨

Let’s dive in! 🤿

## Step 1: 

I’ve always imagined a cozy little café tucked beneath wisteria trees – a place where time slows down, the coffee is always warm, and calm music plays in the background. Since wisteria has always been my favorite flower 🌺 – soft, pastel, and magically scented – the name “Café de Wisteria” came naturally. 🥰

Once I had the general idea of what I wanted to create, I grabbed a pen and paper and started sketching. I doodled wireframes literally everywhere I could. 😂 And yess, it was messy, but it helped me refine my ideas and shape the final concept for my website.

Working on my personal project made me so excited that ideas started popping into my head at the most random times. To make sure I wouldn’t lose any of these little sparks ✨, I created an “idea dump” in my phone’s Notes app. This way, I could keep all my great (or silly 😆) ideas in one place, so I could later go back to pick the ones worth developing. 🥰

# Step 2: Drawing Assets

I’ve always loved pixel art – especially in games like Stardew Valley (my absolute favorite! 🤩) – but I had never tried making any myself.  After I won an iPad from the Codédex May Monthly Challenge (thank you so much again! 🙏), I finally had the perfect excuse to jump into my pixel art journey. 💃🏽

I wanted every component of my website to be in pixel style: social media icons, button icons, header image and even font. So, to grasp the basics, I watched this YouTube video by Saultoons, which covered everything I needed to get started. After that, I created a custom pixel brush in Procreate, made a checklist of assets, and drew them one by one. 

For inspiration, I browsed Pinterest and experimented with color palettes from Lospec.com. Even though I didn’t stick strictly to the palette I chose, this site helped me figure out the overall style I was going for.

To be honest, the pixel art alone took forever, but it was absolutely worth it. 🤩

# Step 3: Designing UI

Creating design of my café website was one of the most beautiful parts of my journey – it’s where I finally started seeing my ideas come to life. ✨

For my UI design I used Canva, simply because I’m familiar with it. You can use whatever program you like – Adobe Illustrator, Figma, etc. – but never underestimate the power of having a design before touching code. Trust me, I tried skipping this step, and the results were nowhere close! 🤣 Having a blueprint to follow meant I could focus on coding without stressing over the look. 

Since creating the art took ages, I didn’t want to wait until it was all finished before moving forward. 😅 So instead, I used Canva elements as placeholders! 🤗 This way, I could still lay out my website, see how everything fit together, and figure out exactly what I’d need to replace with my own pixel art later.

# Step 4: Coding HTML & CSS

Alright, now it was time to start coding my website, yay! 🥳

As a beginner in HTML & CSS, I followed these two resources: Codédex Course: The Origins Trilogy and this YouTube video by SuperSimpleDev. Honestly, those were all I needed to understand the basics, and even some advanced features of HTML and CSS.

Once I felt comfortable with the fundamentals, I downloaded Visual Studio Code on my laptop. I even added some extensions to it, but one of my instant favorites became the Live Server for VS Code – total game-changer! 🤩 It let me see my website update in real time as I coded – no saving, no refreshing, just instant feedback. That made the whole process of coding so much smoother and way more fun. 🥰

Another big priority for me was making sure the website looked good on mobile devices. Imagine being so excited to share your heart-poured site with your friends and siblings… only for them to open it on their phones and see a messy layout! 😱 Noo, thank you! 😅 I really tried my best to make mobile version just as cute and polished as the desktop one. After all, most people browse websites on their phones these days – so, I think keeping that in mind is key for any future project. 😄

# Step 5: Adding JavaScript

I wanted my website to be interactive – something people could actually play around with. But I struggled with the JavaScript part, and it was truly frustrating. 😔 

Instead of giving up and leaving it as a static website, I decided to focus on specific features I wanted to add:

1. 🌓 day/night view of my café, and
2. 🎵 background music to create a cozy vibe.

First of all, I got my royalty-free music from Pixabay. After that, I watched tons of YouTube tutorials, asked ChatGPT for help, and adjusted the code for my website – and I finally made it work! 😍 You can’t imagine how rewarding it feels when you finally figure out something you didn’t even think was possible. 😆

Once my code was ready and I was happy with the result, I pushed it to GitHub and deployed it on Vercel. And just like that, my website was live – my own cozy café corner that I could finally share with the world. 💃

# Final Thoughts

Building your first website isn’t about writing perfect code – it’s about bringing your ideas to life in a way that reflects your personality and feels uniquely YOU.
Of course, you’ll face challenges along the way. Most of the time, you won’t even know exactly what to do (trust me, I didn’t either 😅) – and that’s okay. It takes patience, persistence, and plenty of trial and error. But in the end… you will make it ❤️
I’m sure you already have plenty of cool ideas waiting in your mind. If you’re not sure what to create, my first blog post – 12 Cool Coding Project Ideas For Beginners (Web Dev Edition) – might give you the spark you need. 😍

I hope this was helpful. 💖

Happy coding 🌺,
