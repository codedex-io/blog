_Our "A Day in the Life" series is an inside view into what it’s like working in tech for Gen Zs. From college interns getting their first peek into tech to recent professionals who’ve been on the scene, we’ll share their experience, inspiration, tips & tricks, and more!_

_In the first issue, we are featuring Brandon Lam (he/him), a SWE intern at NASA Glenn Research Center, ISS and Human Research Office. Enjoy!_

##### Hellooo Brandon! Tell us a bit about yourself.

Hey, I’m Brandon! I’m a Software Engineering Intern at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and an incoming junior at the University of Minnesota studying Computer Science. In my free time, I play strategy games like [Teamfight Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamfight_Tactics) (TFT) and [Hearthstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone). I met the Codédex team at HackNYU and loved the platform. Nice to meet you guys!

Fun fact: I’ve peaked top 100 in North America in both games. 🙂

##### What do you do at NASA?

I’m a SWE Intern at [NASA Glenn Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Research_Center) in Cleveland, OH, updating and testing an inventory management site this summer. The internship is two months — from June 5th to August 11th. I’m mainly doing fullstack web development using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [JavaScript](https://www.codedex.io/javascript), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com).

##### How did you get the internship?

I applied last December on [intern.nasa.gov](intern.nasa.gov) and got a a call in March from my current mentor, Nancy. She was interested in my background and thought that I would be a good fit. She also mentioned she was judging for a NASA high school competition in my area and wondered if I’d like to help judge the event the next day. It was an opportunity to talk more about the position.

So the next day, I skipped school and went. Upon arriving, I felt terrified, seeing that the other judges were three NASA employees plus myself. However, the event turned out to be fantastic, and I received valuable advice from the judges. Moreover, I had the opportunity to network with them, and as a result, I was later accepted into my internship!

##### So now you are there... What are the best aspects of working as a NASA intern?

Definitely the incredible people I get to work with on a daily basis. The diversity of expertise and backgrounds of the workers here is unlike anywhere else! I’ve had the privilege to meet people working on all types of projects, such as sending a plant to the moon, improving satellite communications, researching [aerogels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerogel), and creating an email newsletter.

In addition, you can get lots of tours at the facility. Some of my favorite places have been:

- Exercise Countermeasure Lab: Astronauts lose 1% bone mass every month in space, so NASA has special workout equipment created to ensure they stay in shape while on the [ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station). Astronauts in space have to work out for 4 hours each day!
- My roommate’s chemistry lab: The microscope they use is ~20 years old, so the only way for them to retrieve data from it is to use a computer running [Windows 98](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_98). When I asked why they haven’t upgraded, they said, “It still works, why upgrade?”

##### What does a typical work day look like?

My typical work day is no different than any other typical SWE. I get to the office every morning and check my emails. After that, I check to see if I have any meetings for the day and then get to work. Work consists of coding, attending meetings, demoing the website, and writing documentation.

There're also lots of workshops offered onsite that I try to attend and my mentor really encourages networking and attending these since that’s really what the internship is about.

##### Barbie or Oppenheimer? :)

Ooh, I'm gonna have to say Barbie. Oppenheimer was so interesting, but 3 hours is ROUGH.

##### Do you have any tips for younger students?

Get out there and get involved! This can be anything from joining a student organization, attending hackathons, or creating your own personal projects. NASA Glenn received 12,000 applicants this year, and only 162 interns got accepted. 

Every intern I've met here has been insanely talented, sharing one common trait: the ability to apply their knowledge beyond the classroom in the real world.

If you’re interested in attending a hackathon, sign up for the [Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org).

##### What’s a personal project that you're proud of?

The personal project that I’m the proudest of would have to be my TFT Simulator. In [TFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamfight_Tactics), there are lots of luck and chance involved. At the time, there was a debate that was rather 50/50 on the correct decision in the game. So I decided to solve it by using code.

After spending three days researching the math, and learning how to write the code for it, since my numbers kept hitting [integer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). Behind my program, there were 12 different variables and calculations up to 120! (factorial). By the end of the project, I was able to form a conclusion on what the correct play was (both options were correct at the end).
 
This was my first ever personal project and this was really when CS clicked for me. Having the ability to apply my knowledge from school and create something useful was so cool!

##### What inspired you to go for a NASA internship?

My parents are by far my biggest inspiration for me dreaming big. Growing up, my parents both worked 6 days a week, 10 hours a day, to provide for me and my sister, and I am very thankful for them. Their hard work is what motivates me to work so hard. 

As for NASA, I mean, who doesn’t want to work for NASA? It’s NASA!

##### How do you top NASA... What’s your dream job?

It’s hard to say what my dream job is. I’m 19 and in my first two years of college, I changed my major four times. So I’m a rather indecisive person. That being said, I’m just gonna go with the flow and hopefully I’ll end up at my dream job one day!

##### What's been your biggest challenge?

By far the biggest challenge I’ve faced would just be imposter syndrome. I wrote my first line of code two years ago, and I remember during the second week of class, some guy scoffed at me when I asked a question, “This is so easy, how come you can’t do it?”

When it comes to school, I’m not the smartest guy. I’ve dropped Physics three times, I almost failed one of my core CS classes, and I always feel behind compared to my peers.

Despite that, after gaining some work experience, and getting better at coding. What I have to say is that you’re only really applying about 15% of the content you learn in class at work. In addition, comparison is the thief of joy, and as long as I’m enjoying my time learning how to code and creating projects, why should anyone else's opinion matter? 

##### Any last thoughts?

Learning how to code is so unbelievably intimidating. The best way to learn how to code is to get out there and make something you’re interested in. Codédex is an amazing platform and community to start your coding journey, and I love the work that they are doing to gamify and ease beginners into programming.

If your goal one day is to work at NASA or as a software engineer, my one piece of advice is to never stop dreaming. Growing up, NASA has always been a dream of mine to work at and as a result, I pursued my interests and honed my skills to get to where I am today. The experience of working at NASA has truly been out of this world.

Never stop dreaming! 🔭
