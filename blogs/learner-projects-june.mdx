#### Raspberry Pi Project

**Built by:** [@b321gonzo](https://www.codedex.io/@b321gonzo) 🇺🇸
**Tools:** Raspberry Pi, Python

Using a Raspberry Pi and a motor, Brett, aka @b321gonzo, created his first hardware project! When he presses the green button, the motor starts running slowly. If he presses it twice, the motor will speed up. The red button works similarly but in the other direction. If both buttons are pressed, the motor will stop. Pretty cool!

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: "1.2rem", transform: "scale(.9)" }}>
