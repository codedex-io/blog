Hope your year is off to a fantastic start!

We’re stepping into 2025 with serious momentum. Codédex just had our best month ever in terms of user signups, surpassing all previous records. We’re growing fast, shipping even faster, and making big moves to redefine how ppl learn tech skills.

Let’s get into it.

#### Community Revamp

![Community Page](https://i.imgur.com/JQLi0MJ.gif)

The Jackie + Asiqur power duo keeps making waves, now revamping our [On-Platform Community](https://codedex.io/community). We updated the feed algorithm, cleaned up the messy UI (that I originally designed -.-), and introduced a sleek, mobile-responsive navigation that’s way more on-brand. Oh, and did I mention short-form videos? We're coming for Elon and Zuck.

#### Notifications

![Notifications](https://i.imgur.com/5RmurjE.gif)

What’s a social platform without a great notifications system? Now, you can receive likes, comments, and comment replies on *any* page on Codédex. Believe it or not, we’re in the business of motivation, rather than education — and sometimes, a little cheer or high-five can make all the difference in your learning journey.

#### Pricing Page

Every morning, we wake up to a handful questions in Intercom: _"What's the difference between free and Club?"_, _"Can I cancel anytime?"_, _"Are certificates included in Club?"_ It's time to revamp our pricing page. We sunsetted Club 4 Life tier, added a pricing grid, and updated Wall of Love. The impact was immediate: paid signups jumped 20% from December to January!

We are entering fundraising mode! Codédex is raising a "seed round" to accelerate our growth and bring our vision to life. This process is usually hidden behind the scenes, but if you're a superuser and curious about how it all works, feel free to email me at sonny@codedex.io — I’d be happy to share our deck for learning purposes. :)
