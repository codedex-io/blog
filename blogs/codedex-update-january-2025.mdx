Hope your year is off to a fantastic start!

We’re stepping into 2025 with serious momentum. Codédex just had our best month ever in terms of user signups, surpassing all previous records. We’re growing fast, shipping even faster, and making big moves to redefine how ppl learn tech skills.

Let’s get into it.

#### Community Revamp

![Community Page](https://i.imgur.com/JQLi0MJ.gif)

The Jackie + Asiqur power duo keeps making waves, now revamping our [On-Platform Community](https://codedex.io/community). We updated the feed algorithm, cleaned up the messy UI (that I originally designed -.-), and introduced a sleek, mobile-responsive navigation that’s way more on-brand. Oh, and did I mention short-form videos? We're coming for Zuck and Elon!

#### Notifications

![Notifications](https://i.imgur.com/5RmurjE.gif)

What’s a social platform without a great notifications system? You can now receive likes, comments, and replies on *any* page in Codédex. Contrary to belief, we’re more in the business of motivation, rather than education — and sometimes, a little cheer or high-five makes all the difference in your learning journey.

#### Pricing Page

Excited to announce that JAAVAAA Chapters 1-4 are HERE! Free for all users. If you have any questions about the course, tag @Ellie in the **#java** Discord channel. It has some of her favorite references (Club Penguin, Cooking Mama, and more...)
