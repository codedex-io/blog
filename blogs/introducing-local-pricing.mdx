# Introducing Local Pricing 🌎

Hey, Dharma here! Bringing a new update from the Codédex team. Let’s talk pricing. 💸

## Accessibility Isn’t Just About UI

At Codédex, we talk a lot about accessibility in terms of UI/UX design – font sizes, color contrast, responsiveness of the layouts, etc. But, there’s another kind of accessibility that’s just as important: financial accessibility.

We’re on a mission to provide the best tech education in the world and make it universally available – no matter your background or where you live. We’ve always believed that anyone, anywhere, should be able to learn to code in 2025. Since starting this company, 500,000+ registered users from 192 countries have joined our platform.

Our current [Codédex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) is $12.99/month or $95.88/year.

To support this, we introduced a discount based on pricing parity for six countries in 2024: 🇮🇳India, 🇲🇽Mexico, 🇨🇴Colombia, 🇦🇷Argentina, 🇮🇩Indonesia, and 🇵🇭Philippines.

This month, we added 3 new countries to this list: 🇧🇷Brazil, 🇨🇱 Chile, and 🇻🇳Vietnam. As of today, if you’re in one of the following countries, you’ll now see a discounted monthly and annual subscription price for Codédex Club, tailored to your local economy.

| Country          | Tier        | Monthly Price       | Annual Price      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 🇮🇳 India       | 3 (75% off) | ₹279 ($3.25)        | ₹2049 ($24)       |
| 🇲🇽 Mexico      | 2 (50% off) | MX$130 ($6.50)      | MX$960 ($48)      |
| 🇨🇴 Colombia    | 2 (50% off) | COP$26,930 ($6.50)  | COP$198,817 ($48) |
| 🇦🇷 Argentina   | 3 (50% off) | ARS$6,999 ($6.50)   | ARS$51,449 ($48)  |
| 🇮🇩 Indonesia   | 3 (50% off) | IDR 107,640 ($6.50) | IDR 794,880 ($48) |
| 🇵🇭 Philippines | 2 (50% off) | PHP 370 ($6.50)     | PHP 2,760 ($48)   |
| 🇧🇷 Brazil      | 3 (50% off) | R$37 ($6.50)        | R$270 ($48)       |
| 🇻🇳 Vietnam     | 3 (75% off) | VND 83,297 ($3.25)  | VND 615,118 ($24) |
| 🇨🇱 Chile       | 2 (50% off) | CLP$6,000 ($6.50)   | CLP$44,330 ($48)  |

We picked these countries because they are part of our top 20 countries and we arrived at these pricepoints by looking at data from the World Bank, calculating the ratio of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, adjusted for PPP, as well as talking with our international users.

These prices should update automatically based on your location. If you’re traveling, on a VPN, or something looks off, feel free to reach out to us at help@codedex.io and we’ll help you.

## Why We’re Doing This 💛

We’re a small team, and like most startups, we have to make tough calls about what to build next. Supporting the Codédex community has never been an afterthought—just look at our involvement with the GitHub Student Pack, Monthly Challenges, and plenty more.

We’ve seen amazing technologists join Codédex from all over the world – from high schoolers to college students, career switchers to vibe coders. We want all of you to be able to stick around, level up, and build cool stuff without pricing being a blocker.

This is just one step towards achieving that goal.

What’s Next? ⏭️

We’re still learning how to do this well. Localization is tricky, exchange rates fluctuate, and no pricing model is perfect. But our aim is simple: make Codédex fairer and more accessible for everyone.

More to come soon! Until then –

Happy coding,
Dharma
