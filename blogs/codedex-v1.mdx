Hi friends,

Today is the day. ü•≤

After three years in the making, we‚Äôre officially launching **Cod√©dex v1.0**! üöÄüöÄüöÄ

We had our first Product Hunt launch in 2022 with just a four-chapter Python course. Now, in 2025, we‚Äôre back ‚Äì bigger, better, and with a brand-new animated launch video to celebrate this milestone.

Help us reach **#1 Product of the Day** today (Tuesday, 8/12) by giving us an upvote here:

üîó https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex?launch=codedex-v1-0

It would mean the world. Every upvote matters. Let‚Äôs make history together.

Now, let's get into the weeds of this update. I‚Äôll first pass it off to Jackie to go over product changes.

## v1.0 Product updates

Hey everybody, [Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline) (Senior Product Designer @ Cod√©dex) here! 

As part of this v1.0 launch, we bundled together some pretty *major* product changes. We‚Äôve released so much the past year in terms of our Community features, #30NitesOfCode, and more ‚Äì but our goal now was to tighten up the core learning experience.

### Learning environment upgrades

The **Learning Environment** (LE) is the most important, and most used part of our platform‚Ä¶ and it was due for an upgrade! We went through and documented all the UX problems of our previous LE and chatted with a tons of our superusers.

Our new learning environment includes navigation improvements, a progress bar to show your completion of exercises, and a cleaner, streamlined interface. Plus, learning and coding on mobile is now easier too!

<div style={{textAlign: "center"}}>(Yay! Sooo clean.)</div>

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: "1.2rem", transform: "scale(.9)" }}>
  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/python/01-setting-up" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">See new LE</Button></a>
</div>

### More course cutscenes

We know you all love our cutscenes: our animated, movie-like moments that appear in a few select courses as you complete chapters‚Ä¶ so we‚Äôve added them to every course!

Whenever you complete a chapter in any course, you‚Äôll see a cutscene that celebrates your hard work, relays your stats, and new badges earned. Additionally, unlock special cutscenes when you begin a course for the first time, or complete one all the way to the end~ ü§´

### Challenge Pack Redesign

We also updated the design of [Challenge Packs](https://www.codedex.io/challenges)! We‚Äôve leaned into making Challenge Packs feel like a trading card game, taking light visual inspiration from a certain monster-battling card game and international media franchise‚Ä¶ with our own learn-to-code spin! We also made our Challenge Pack UI consistent with our new Learning Environment, so practicing code can be familiar no matter where you are on the platform.

  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/challenges" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">Try Code Challenges</Button></a>
</div>

### New landing page art

Last but not least, we launched a BEAUTIFUL new pixel art landing page that was illustrated and animated by our friend [moawling](https://www.google.com/search?q=moawling&sca_esv=e530de37feccd403&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS951US953&sxsrf=AE3TifOfJ_VEPMe9_4cUy8U-EBKkZkJLiA%3A1754601655807&ei=txiVaOH7MOyo5NoPp7LZKA&ved=0ahUKEwihs6rD0PmOAxVsFFkFHSdZFgUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=moawling&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCG1vYXdsaW5nMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGAoYHjIEEAAYHjIIEAAYgAQYogQyBRAAGO8FSIUEUABYiQNwAHgBkAEAmAHEAaAB1AeqAQMwLja4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgagAoUIwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgsQLhiABBixAxjUAsICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgUQLhiABMICCxAuGIAEGMcBGK8BwgIHEAAYgAQYCpgDAOIDBRIBMSBAkgcFMC41LjGgB48wsgcFMC41LjG4B4UIwgcFMi01LjHIBys&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)! We worked together and pulled inspiration from classic RPG game art to reimagine our original landing page into one that was much more epic and adventurous.

Finally, shoutout to small-but-mighty engineering team ([Asiqur](https://www.codedex.io/@asiqur) & [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma)) for doing a superhuman amount of work towards this release! üí™üí™

See y‚Äôall soon! ~Jackie

> ‚ÄúBecause when you know how things are made, whether it‚Äôs software, or the toasters in the oven, when you know how to make, you also know how to dismantle it when you need to.‚Äù - Jenn Schiffer

## So what's next?

Now that we've laid an incredible foundation and carved out a special place in this space, it's time to get wild with it. Curriculum, Daily Challenge, Mobile companion app, Worlds 2.0, Builds 2.0, OPC, Storyline, and more.

A lot of people have asked me what is Cod√©dex. At this point, it‚Äôs not even a product. It‚Äôs a love letter to all the beautiful parts about technology and what holds us together as humanity. üíå Hope it finds the people who need it.

I‚Äôm beyond proud of what we accomplished with this ride-or-die team, and I‚Äôm beyond honored to present you... Cod√©dex v1.0.

Happy coding! ‚ãÜÀô‚ü°
