Hi everyone, 

Three years in the making, it is officially here. **Codédex v1.0** is a love letter to technology, to creativity, and the ways they connect us, despite everything. 💌

## Product Hunt 

We had our first Product Hunt launch in 2022 with just a prototype. Now, in 2025 and 1 million learners later, we’re back – bigger, better, and with a brand-new animated launch video to celebrate this milestone.

We’re launching on [‪Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex?launch=codedex-v1-0)‬ on 8/12/2025. PLEASE give us an upvote! 🚀

## v1.0 Product updates

Hey everybody, [Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline) (Sr. Product Designer @ Codédex) here! 

As part of this v1.0 launch, we bundled together some pretty *major* product changes. We’ve released so much the past year in terms of our Community features, #30NitesOfCode, and more – but our goal now was to tighten up the core learning experience.

### Learning environment revamp

![Learning enviornment: before and after](https://i.imgur.com/jD47Qk0.png)

The **learning environment** (LE) is the most important, and most used part of our platform… and it was due for an upgrade! We went through and documented all the UX problems of our previous LE and chatted with a tons of our superusers.

Our new learning environment includes navigation improvements, a progress bar at the top to show your completion of exercises, and a cleaner, streamlined interface. Plus, learning and coding on mobile is now easier, too! 📱

  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/python/01-setting-up" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">See LE glow up</Button></a>
</div>

### More course cutscenes

![](https://i.imgur.com/sUe4hMX.gif)

We know you all love our cutscenes: our animated, movie-like moments that appear in a few select courses as you complete chapters… so we’ve added them to every course!

Whenever you complete a chapter in any course, you’ll see a cutscene that celebrates your hard work, relays your stats, and new badges earned. Additionally, unlock special cutscenes when you begin a course for the first time, or complete one all the way to the end~ 🤫

### Challenge Pack redesign

![Challenge Packs: Before and After](https://i.imgur.com/6nSufrr.png)

We also updated the design of [Challenge Packs](https://www.codedex.io/challenges)! We’ve leaned into making Challenge Packs feel like a trading card game, taking light visual inspiration from a certain monster-battling card game and international media franchise… with our own learn-to-code spin! We also made our Challenge Pack UI consistent with our new learning environment, so practicing code can be familiar no matter where you are on the platform.

</div>

### New landing page art

Last but not least, we launched a ✨ BEAUTIFUL ✨ new pixel art landing page that was illustrated and animated by our friend [moawling](https://www.moaw.art), iconic pixel artist & game dev! We worked together and pulled inspiration from classic RPG game art to reimagine our original landing page into one that was much more epic, welcoming, and adventurous.

#### The before...

Finally, shoutout to small-but-mighty engineering team ([Asiqur](https://www.codedex.io/@asiqur) & [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma)) for doing a superhuman amount of work towards this release! 💪💪

See y’all soon! ~Jackie

## v1.0 Curriculum updates

![Three courses](https://i.imgur.com/FvtY5fj.png)

We have not one, two, three, but four courses on the way. 😱

### Game Dev / Phaser course

![](https://i.imgur.com/BFKkpAe.png)

Our first game development course is here. 2 chapters drop today! 👾

You've been asking for it (via recent polls in Discord, socials, and Question of the Week), and we heard you. Game dev has officially landed on Codédex. We are starting with [Phaser](https://www.codedex.io/phaser), a powerful HTML framework to build your own 2D online game for web developers. 

P.S. For those hungry for more, we’ve got an accelerated Lua course in the works, too.

  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/phaser" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">Build your first mini-game</Button></a>
</div>

### Pandas course + Machine Learning course

![pandas and machine learning](https://i.imgur.com/yXa9ssH.gif)

Both [Pandas](https://www.codedex.io/pandas) & [Machine Learning](https://www.codedex.io/machine-learning) courses are out! For the Data Science journey: Python -> NumPy -> Pandas -> Matplotlib (coming soon!) -> Machine Learning -> SQL. By the end, you’ll be able to clean data, crunch numbers, visualize insights, and build predictive models. These courses are written by my good friend Alex Kuntz, an edtech veteran with 8+ years of curriculum dev experience and former CS teacher!

  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/courses" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">Check out new courses</Button></a>
</div>

### Bonus: GitHub Copilot course

![GitHub Copilot](https://i.imgur.com/961bD0F.png)

This is a partnership course with the team at GitHub Edu and Microsoft. It will be out **8/31**.

### Walkthrough videos

![walkthrough video](https://i.imgur.com/4SWzt7S.gif)

Visual learners, this one’s for you! We’re adding byte-sized walkthrough videos inside course exercises, so you’ll always have an instructor guiding you through the steps if you get stuck. We’re starting with Python and expanding to HTML next. Plus, we'll upload full chapter videos on YouTube so you can revisit them anytime. 📺 

Feedback welcome! Please let us know what you think in Discord or OPC.

## v1.0 Launch video

![flavor deck](https://i.imgur.com/YrQwj1J.gif)

We collaborated with our friends at [Flavor TV](https://www.flavor.tv) to bring the Codédex universe to life. Huge thanks to everyone on their team who touched the styleframes, animations, sound design, the countless revisions that went into these 60 seconds frame by frame to capture the magic of the brand. We start in a quiet Studio Ghibli nightfall and enters a pixel world bursting with light, sound, and possibility. Each frame drawn with love. SO happy how it turned out. 😍

## So what's next?

Hope you enjoy v1.0 update and please lmk what you think! 🙏

Now you must be wondering... what now?

For the past three years, we've worked tirelessly to carve out our own little corner in the learn-to-code space and lay an incredible foundation for a skyscraper. For the first time, people can start to _see_ the vision of Codédex.

Now it’s time to really play and make our product 10x stronger. On the horizon: more depth in curriculum, more videos, Daily Quests 🤫, a mobile companion app, Worlds 2.0, Builds 2.0, OPC iterations, storyline, and more. The momentum is on our side, it's time to double down on what makes Codédex special and build out a delightful and unforgetable experience that pushes the frontier of online learning to a whole new level.

My initial question remains, _Can we design a learning experience that truly blurs the line between learning / playing – one that makes people laugh, smile, and even cry?_

So much more to come. Back to work. :)

Sonny
