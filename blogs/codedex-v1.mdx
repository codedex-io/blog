Hi friends, 

Insert Sonny’s CEO blurb, blah blah here’s the journey of Codédex since 2022. We had our first Product Hunt launch in 2022, and finally have one again in the year 2025. We also have a really cool official animated launch video to celebrate this milestone. Make sure to upvote on product hunt… here’s how!

First thing first, I’ll pass it off to Jackie to go over the product updates!

## v1.0 Product updates

Hey everybody, [Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline) (Senior Product Designer @ Codédex) here! 

As part of this v1.0 launch, we bundled together some pretty *major* product changes. We’ve released so much the past year in terms of our Community features, #30NitesOfCode, and more – but our goal now was to tighten up the core learning experience.

### Learning environment upgrades

The Learning Environment (LE) is the most important, and most used part of our platform… and it was due for an upgrade! We went through and documented all the UX problems of our previous LE.

Our new learning environment includes navigation improvements, a progress bar to show your completion of exercises, and a cleaner, streamlined interface. Plus, learning and coding on mobile is now easier too!

### More course cutscenes

We know you all love our cutscenes: our animated, movie-like moments that appear in a few select courses as you complete chapters… so we’ve added them to every course!

Whenever you complete a chapter in any course, you’ll see a cutscene that celebrates your hard work, relays your stats, and new badges earned. Additionally, unlock special cutscenes when you begin a course for the first time, or complete one all the way to the end~

### Challenge Pack Redesign

We also updated the design of [Challenge Packs](https://www.codedex.io/challenges)! We’ve leaned into making Challenge Packs feel like a trading card game, taking light visual inspiration from a certain monster-battling card game and international media franchise… with our own learn-to-code spin! We also made our Challenge Pack UI consistent with our new Learning Environment, so practicing code can be familiar no matter where you are on the platform.

### New landing page art

Last but not least, we launched a BEAUTIFUL new pixel art landing page that was illustrated and animated by our friend [moawling](https://www.google.com/search?q=moawling&sca_esv=e530de37feccd403&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS951US953&sxsrf=AE3TifOfJ_VEPMe9_4cUy8U-EBKkZkJLiA%3A1754601655807&ei=txiVaOH7MOyo5NoPp7LZKA&ved=0ahUKEwihs6rD0PmOAxVsFFkFHSdZFgUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=moawling&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCG1vYXdsaW5nMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGAoYHjIEEAAYHjIIEAAYgAQYogQyBRAAGO8FSIUEUABYiQNwAHgBkAEAmAHEAaAB1AeqAQMwLja4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgagAoUIwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgsQLhiABBixAxjUAsICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgUQLhiABMICCxAuGIAEGMcBGK8BwgIHEAAYgAQYCpgDAOIDBRIBMSBAkgcFMC41LjGgB48wsgcFMC41LjG4B4UIwgcFMi01LjHIBys&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)! We worked together and pulled inspiration from classic RPG game art to reimagine our original landing page into one that was much more epic and adventurous.

Finally, shoutout to small but mighty engineering team (Asiqur and Dharma) for doing a superhuman amount of work towards this release! 💪💪

See ya’ll soon! ~Jackie

## So what's next?

Now that we've laid an incredible foundation. Curriculum, Daily Challenge, Mobile (OPC, pet, Daily Challenge, podcast, videos, flashcards), Worlds, Builds, OPC, Storyline, Teacher Dashboard. 

A lot of people have asked me what is Codédex. At this point, it’s not even a product. It’s a love letter to all the beautiful parts about technology and what holds us together as humanity.

I’m beyond proud of what we accomplished with this ride-or-die team, and I’m beyond honored to present you: Codédex, a love letter to .

if you’re referencing the video?) is a love letter to all the beautiful parts of technology. 💌 hope it finds the people who need it. 

we’re just getting started. here’s to (so much) more. 🌎

Feel free to ask us any questions and share your progress - we're here for you.

Happy coding! ⋆˙⟡
