Hi friends,

Today is the day. 🥲

After three years in the making, we’re officially launching **Codédex v1.0**! 🚀🚀🚀

We had our first Product Hunt launch in 2022 with just a four-chapter Python course. Now, in 2025, we’re back – bigger, better, and with a brand-new animated launch video to celebrate this milestone.

Help us reach **#1 Product of the Day** today (Tuesday, 8/12) by giving us an upvote here:

🔗 https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex?launch=codedex-v1-0

It would mean the world. Every upvote matters. Let’s make history together.

Now, let's get into the weeds of this update. I’ll first pass it off to Jackie to go over product changes.

## v1.0 Product updates

Hey everybody, [Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline) (Senior Product Designer @ Codédex) here! 

As part of this v1.0 launch, we bundled together some pretty *major* product changes. We’ve released so much the past year in terms of our Community features, #30NitesOfCode, and more – but our goal now was to tighten up the core learning experience.

### Learning environment upgrades

The **Learning Environment** (LE) is the most important, and most used part of our platform… and it was due for an upgrade! We went through and documented all the UX problems of our previous LE and chatted with a tons of our superusers.

Our new learning environment includes navigation improvements, a progress bar to show your completion of exercises, and a cleaner, streamlined interface. Plus, learning and coding on mobile is now easier too!

  <a style={{ all: "unset" }} href="https://www.codedex.io/python/01-setting-up" target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">See what's different</Button></a>
</div>

### More course cutscenes

We know you all love our cutscenes: our animated, movie-like moments that appear in a few select courses as you complete chapters… so we’ve added them to every course!

Whenever you complete a chapter in any course, you’ll see a cutscene that celebrates your hard work, relays your stats, and new badges earned. Additionally, unlock special cutscenes when you begin a course for the first time, or complete one all the way to the end~ 🤫

### Challenge Pack Redesign

We also updated the design of [Challenge Packs](https://www.codedex.io/challenges)! We’ve leaned into making Challenge Packs feel like a trading card game, taking light visual inspiration from a certain monster-battling card game and international media franchise… with our own learn-to-code spin! We also made our Challenge Pack UI consistent with our new Learning Environment, so practicing code can be familiar no matter where you are on the platform.

</div>

### New landing page art

Last but not least, we launched a BEAUTIFUL new pixel art landing page that was illustrated and animated by our friend [moawling](https://www.google.com/search?q=moawling&sca_esv=e530de37feccd403&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS951US953&sxsrf=AE3TifOfJ_VEPMe9_4cUy8U-EBKkZkJLiA%3A1754601655807&ei=txiVaOH7MOyo5NoPp7LZKA&ved=0ahUKEwihs6rD0PmOAxVsFFkFHSdZFgUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=moawling&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCG1vYXdsaW5nMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBhAAGAoYHjIEEAAYHjIIEAAYgAQYogQyBRAAGO8FSIUEUABYiQNwAHgBkAEAmAHEAaAB1AeqAQMwLja4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgagAoUIwgILEAAYgAQYkQIYigXCAgsQLhiABBixAxjUAsICCBAuGIAEGLEDwgIIEAAYgAQYsQPCAgUQLhiABMICCxAuGIAEGMcBGK8BwgIHEAAYgAQYCpgDAOIDBRIBMSBAkgcFMC41LjGgB48wsgcFMC41LjG4B4UIwgcFMi01LjHIBys&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)! We worked together and pulled inspiration from classic RPG game art to reimagine our original landing page into one that was much more epic and adventurous.

Finally, shoutout to small-but-mighty engineering team ([Asiqur](https://www.codedex.io/@asiqur) & [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma)) for doing a superhuman amount of work towards this release! 💪💪

See y’all soon! ~Jackie

## v1.0 Curriculum updates

We have not one, two, three, but four courses on the way. 

### Game Dev / Phaser.js course

Our first game development course is here. 2 Chapters will be out today!

### Pandas course + Machine Learning course

First chapter of both courses are releasing today. 

## GitHub Copilot

This is a partnership course with the team at GitHub Edu and Microsoft. It will be out 8/31.

### Walkthrough videos

Some learners are visual learners. So we are starting. First with Python, then HTML. Let me know what you think!

## v1.0 Launch video

We collaborated with our friends at [Flavor TV](https://www.flavor.tv) to bring our launch video to life. Huge thanks to everyone who touched the styleframes, the animations, the countless revisions that went into these 60 seconds and the magic that makes the Codédex world feel alive. In it, we start in a quiet pixel world and journey to one bursting with light, sound, and possibility. That’s exactly what this moment feels like.

## So what's next?

We’ve built an incredible foundation and carved out a special little corner in the learn to code space. Now it’s time to really play: more depth in our curriculum, Daily Challenges, mobile companion app, Worlds 2.0, Builds 2.0, OPC, Storyline, and more. We made it through the hardest part of the company (and boy was it hard...), and somehow scaled this cliff. Now it's time to truly play and double down on what makes Codédex what it is and build out a delightful and unforgetable experience. 

People often ask me, _what is Codédex_? It’s a gamified learn-to-code platform. A social community. A stubborn, ride-or-die team building in a forsaken “dead space” because we still believe. It’s three years of our lives, poured into something we wish we had when we started and the world needs. It's countless community members who shown us so much grace and support that changed my life for the better and makes me a better person.

At this point, it’s not just a product. It’s a part of us.

To wrap it up, I couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve built together, and I couldn’t be more honored to share it with you... Codédex v1.0, a love letter to technology, to childlike creativity, and to the ways they keep us together as humanity. 💌

May it find the ones who need it most. ⋆˙⟡

Sonny
