Wanna know the coolest thing about coding?

You can build whatever you want! 😍

At first, you’re super excited by all the possibilities. But if you’re just starting out, that excitement can quickly turn into confusion. There are so many programming languages, countless tutorials, and maybe you just finished a course and now you’re thinking: “Uhmm… what should I do next?”
If that sounds familiar – don’t worry. I’ve been there too. ❤

Hi, I’m Sophie [@marsianer](https://www.codedex.io/@MarSianer), a lvl. 6 learner based in Frankfurt, Germany 🇩🇪 and am currently on my day 46 streak on Codédex! I recently won the [May Monthly Challenge: Lightning Talk](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/aZwonmhOYu8BWfZLpGZK?tab=winners) where I made a fun slide deck on this topic and the community LOVED it. The Codédex team liked it too and invited me to turn it into a blog post! Yay!

To make your coding journey way more fun (and actually effective), I stumbled upon something that changed everything for me: building cool real-world projects (that are cool, of course)! 😎

In this blog post, I’ll show you why creating cool stuff is one of the best ways to learn new skills, walk you through a simple step-by-step process to get started, and share 12 cool, beginner-friendly coding project ideas (with real examples!) to spark your creativity and help you build things you're truly excited about. 💃🏽

So, let’s jump into it!

## Why is it so awesome to build cool stuff?

1. **You learn what you actually need** - You don’t waste time learning programming languages you’ll never use. The project leads the way, and you pick up just what you need to bring your idea to life. ✨
2. **The process excites you and keeps you motivated** - You don’t have to force or trick yourself into working on your project. You want to spend as much time on it as you can because it’s really fun. 🤩
3. **You think about it allll the time** - New ideas hit you at midnight and you’re typing in your notes app like a mad genius. 🤯 
4. **You stack multiple skills** - When you create your own little app or website, you’re a developer, UI designer, illustrator, copywriter, and sketch artist all in one (if you love doodling your ideas first, like I do). 😂

Alright, let’s say you are convinced to start making cool projects. But how do you actually build one?

## Process of building cool stuff

![idea to learn to build to share and get feedback](https://i.imgur.com/ppvMokp.png)

### Learn

Once you’ve got an idea, you figure out which programming languages you need and which tools might be helpful for you. Google stuff, ask for guidance in the Codédex Discord or the on-platform [community](https://www.codedex.io/community), or simply use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).

For example, if I want to build cute little websites and desktop apps, I need the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, plus Figma to design layouts, Photoshop or Canva to make illustrations, and yess… a good pencil and paper to sketch out my ideas. 😍

So, the tools you need really depend on your project and your process. 

### Build

You build as you go. Fix one bug. Create one new feature at a time. This approach helps you stay focused and prevents you from feeling overwhelmed by trying to learn everything at once.

### Share & Get Feedback

It’s exciting to share your project with your siblings, friends, family, or even post on social media. Sharing your cool stuff brings fresh perspectives and the encouragement you need to keep going. 🚀

### Idea

But what if you have no idea what to create? 🤔

Well, I hope this next part sparks some cool ideas for you. 💖

## 12 cool coding project ideas

![egg timer, water your plants, what should i wear today](https://i.imgur.com/KOActOj.png)

### 1. Timer

If you love soft, juicy eggs, you know how frustrating it is when you forget them on the stove and end up boiling them for 20 minutes (or is that too niche?!). Maybe this is your sign to create an egg timer! 🤩 You could also make a chill little meditation timer with calming sounds, a Pomodoro timer for your study sessions or even a workout interval timer for your HIIT exercises. This is a project you'll genuinely enjoy and find useful in real life.

✨ Some cool timer projects:

- [Egg Timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TODW-IP4XM)
- [Meditation Timer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_1n6owqruc)
- [Lumon Pomodoro](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/L35fixvpxWg5pGY8vhAN) (from the _Severance_ show!)
- [Build a Pomodoro App with HTML, CSS, JavaScript](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-pomodoro-app-with-html-css-js)

### 2. Reminder

Forgot to water your plants again? 😪 Then you should build a reminder app for your plant babies. 🌱 If you’re into self-care, create one to remind yourself to drink water throughout the day, take screen breaks, or do quick stretches during long work sessions.

✨ Some project ideas:

- [Water Your Plants](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHgx3zCS-OT)

## Final thoughts

Now, you’ve got 12 cool coding project ideas right in front of you. ✨

Pick the project that sounds the most fun and interesting and just start building!

From now on, forget stressing over which programming language to start with. Instead, ask yourself:

- What do I wish existed?
- What do I like outside of coding? Reading? Music? Games?
- What do I really want to create? Not for a job application, but for myself.
- What can I build for my friends & family, my local community, or even the world?
- Write down all your ideas, think about how you’d design them and which programming languages you’d use. Take notes, draw little sketches, and make that crazy, cool idea happen! 😍

Happy coding 💖, 
Sophie Gabe
