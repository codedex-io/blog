Hi, [Julien](https://www.codedex.io/@Julien) here! I’m excited to chat with y’all about a web design & development trend (really more like a movement) that’s made a comeback in recent years: super simple sites made with vanilla HTML, and maybe a teeny bit of CSS if we’re feeling fancy. 

#### Coding The Web From Scratch

These simple sites range from simple portfolio sites, to fansites, virtual gardens, to entire games, all written by hand, as simply as possible! One of the things I appreciate most about the return of simple sites is that they lower the barrier to entry for emerging devs.

I see it as the conceptual and aesthetic opposite of [Vibe Coding](https://alitu.com/creator/workflow/what-is-vibe-coding/), aka using AI to code complex projects without writing a single line of code, lol. Instead, this trend is about making everything from scratch, as simply and accessibly as possible. 

I think of this barebones approach to web development as a way of resisting [Enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) – am I allowed to use that word here? Guess we’ll find out if it gets published.

#### Taking Things Apart and Putting Them Back Together

In our Hacker House Chat with [Jenn Schiffer](https://jennschiffer.com/) (which we’ll release as a Boba Talk episode soon!), we discussed the joy of making things from scratch, and the way that doing so empowers us to fully understand the processes (and ethical implications!) of the tech we use, and by extension, align our values with our work. 

This quote from Jenn has stuck with me:

>When you know how things are made, whether it’s software, or the toaster in your kitchen, or in my case a candle or watercolor paint, when you know how to make it, you also know how to _dismantle_ it if you need to.

Also, a special shoutout to “The internet is my girl, despite everything”.

In J.R. Carpenter’s statement on The Handmade Web, she writes: 

>I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity.

Let’s journey back 2 basics ~

#### Fanpages

We often think of fanpages as internet shrines to our favorite shows, movies, actors, etc. We had a blast exploring fanpages with y’all in our last [Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/holiday-hackathon)!

For a long time though, I’ve wanted to write about my favorite website as a child: purple.com, a fanpage for the HTML color purple. Perhaps someday I’ll even make a fanpage for that fanpage. 

Its earliest iteration was simply a magenta screen. The fact that this was not _really_ purple entertained me to no end, and was eventually added to their FAQ page, which was, to my delight, actually purple.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "space-around",
  }}
>

</div>

What was the point? Its existence was the point, and its owner insisted throughout the course of almost twenty years that it would never, ever, ever, be for sale. Eventually, dear reader, it was purchased by the mattress company Purple. 🟣

Not to get too philosophical over here, but making things just because you want to make things is kind of the whole point of…everything?

Let’s get into something more ~contemporary~.

#### HTML Energy

[HMTL Energy](https://html.energy/index.html) is a practice dedicated to creating, teaching, and supporting HTML-only projects. 

The term was coined by artists Laurel Schwulst and Elliott Cost in, and it signals a return to the simple, nostalgic websites of the early internet.

![HTML Energy](https://i.imgur.com/63wHYOK.gif)

It lives as a community, website, are.na board, podcast, and event series where anyone can gather and write HTML together!

Its core goals are as follows:

1. **The human goal**: to show people that the web is still alive. And to actively make the web more human and handmade.
2. **The educational goal**: to teach people of all ages to write HTML. Our dream would be to get HTML into schools or curriculums.
3. **The energetic goal**: to reveal the raw energy of HTML. Approaching HTML as you would anything that excites you in life.

Even its source code is delightful:

#### Virtual Gardens

One of my favorite parts of this return to simplicity is building virtual gardens. These often take the form of literal gardens, as in the case of Spencer Chang’s [HTML Garden](https://www.htmls.garden/), a collaborative community garden made entirely with HTML.

Sometimes, the gardens are more of a conceptual framing device, or a philosophy for how one could approach building their own site. Gardens are often seen as a collection of resources, continually tended to.

The Soupbone Collective’s [Soupbone Garden](https://www.soupbonecollective.org/garden) is

>A digital garden is a space of care to which you continually return. This is our garden for the humanities. Currently, it contains several plots: a public commonplace book, a collection of learning resources, a podcast, and a residency archive. This garden is a living space; we’re planning to grow and plant more in the future.

In an essay for The Creative Independent, Lauren Schwulst writes:

>Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once they’re little seedlings and can stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.

>Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and that’s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both. Plants remind us that life is about balance.

>It’s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.
