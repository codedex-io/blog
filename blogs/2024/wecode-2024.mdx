Hello CS students, **Harvard WECode 2024** is happening this weekend (February 17-18) and Codédex is sponsoring the event! 🚌💨

## What the heck is WECode?

[WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com) is the world’s largest student-run women in tech conference. It’s a two-day event packed full of panel talks, fireside chats, and workshops. Over a thousand students from 300+ universities are attending – this is a perfect opportunity to meet fellow techies from other schools.

This year, Codédex team members 👩🏻‍💻 [Katherin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katherin-s-29970a124), 👩🏻‍💻 [Naomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomixlee), 👨🏻‍💻 [Sonny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonnynomnom) are traveling to Cambridge, MA to attend! Yayyy!

It'll be the last stop of our Mini Campus Tour:

- ⛳️ TartanHacks (Pittsburgh, PA) on 2/3
- ⛳️ SBUHacks (Stony Brook, NY) on 2/10
- ⛳️ WECode (Cambridge, MA) on 2/18 ✨

## How to find us?

We’ll be filming on-the-street style interview videos, passing out limited edition merch on Sunday (February 18), and chatting with everyone!

There will also be a **Codédex booth at the Career Fair (Sunday @ 3-5 pm)**, where you'll get to meet the team, grab free stickers, learn all about Codédex, and for a chance to be in our new **Codédex Creator Program**. 🔥

See you this weekend!
