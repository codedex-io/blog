Exciting news! Cod√©dex is now part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.codedex.io/github-students)!!! ü•≥

## Spill the tea! What does this mean for me?

If you are a verified student through GitHub Education, you can receive 6 months of [Cod√©dex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) ‚Äî a premium membership ‚Äî for FREE!

With a Cod√©dex Club membership, you‚Äôll gain access to:

- üåà Full content catalog: The Legend of Python, Origins Trilogy, and more
- ‚ûï Bonus Articles & Cheat Sheets as supplemental material
- üé¥ Challenge Packs (think LeetCode!)
- üöÄ Checkpoint and Final Projects 
- üìú Course Certificates
- üóìÔ∏è Exclusive invites to community events

## Why we partnered with GitHub Education

TL;DR is that it made sense! This is a dream collab. üòá

The longer story: Much like GitHub‚Äôs mission statement to ‚Äúhelp every developer ‚Äî regardless of experience ‚Äî learn, code and ship software effectively,‚Äù Cod√©dex is on a mission to level up the next wave of builders. We‚Äôre firm believers that every aspiring developer needs a strong foundation that‚Äôs accessible both in price and approach. 

We‚Äôre thrilled to be part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and offer a 6-month Cod√©dex Club membership to help YOU get started!

And if we‚Äôre really being honest on why we partnered with GitHub, it‚Äôs a full circle moment for our small but mighty team ‚Äî we love GitHub and use it every day! &lt;derp>3

## Why Cod√©dex is great for students

Your CS professor will likely bore you, but we won‚Äôt. Our team promises to deliver fun and accessible content on the most popular programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

We‚Äôve designed our curriculum so that you‚Äôll gain a strong foundation in coding fundamentals and that will help you put into practice what you last learned. At the end of each course, you‚Äôll bring it full circle with a real-world project. Along the way, you‚Äôll unlock bonus articles and cheat sheets that supplement what you learn in each chapter.

And did I mention community?! We have a robust community on our platform & in Discord. Weekly, we host fun events such as Office Hours, Project Show & Tell, tech workshops ([Getting Started with GitHub](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207055343331442688) coming up!), [Monthly Challenges](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/february-2024), Watch Parties, and more.

## Wait! Do I qualify for this?

To qualify for student benefits, you must:

- Have a GitHub account.
- Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study from a recognized educational institution.
- Be able to provide documentation from your school that shows your student status.
