We’re back and better with another... #30NitesOfCode!!! Let's gooo! 👾 

## What is #30NitesOfCode?

**#30NitesOfCode** is a habit-building challenge where you commit to 30 days of learning and building. The best part? You get to care for a virtual pet who'll be your companion throughout your journey! ^.^ As you code every month, your pet grows and even evolves!

Fun fact: It's inspired by #100DaysOfCode, Tamagotchi, and Duolingo streaks. We frankensteined the three elements into something the world has never seen before. 😍

Why you’ll love it:

- 🥚 Raise a virtual pet along your coding journey
- 🐣 Accountability from the community via Twitter, OPC, and Discord
- 🐥 Learn and build new skills along the way

You can do this challenge via Twitter or our on-platform community (OPC). Your choice!

## What happened in January?

We had a [January Monthly Challenge](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/january-2024) around the #30NitesOfCode pilot from 1/1/2024 to 1/30/2024, and it was a smash hit; people had SO much fun! 

Over 517 people claimed their pet and posted:

- 2466 times on Twitter
- 324 times in the OPC

Here are some of feedback we've gotten:

We learned so much (what worked & what didn't) and took it down for a month to iterate.


## So what's new in v2?

Today, we've relaunched the feature with some major changes:

- #30NitesOfCode is now an evergreen feature! You may start on any day of the month.
- Added [#30NitesOfCode channel](https://www.codedex.io/community/30-nites-of-code) in the OPC - great for posting if you’re not on Twitter.
- Pets are "limited edition". We will have new pets every year! This also means our current pets will be phased out in 2025. Collect 'em while you can!
- The Hall of Fame goes beyond 30 days, so it's more like a leaderboard.
- Introducing: Pet Cafe! A home for all your pets in the User Profile. 🐶 🐱 🐭 🐵 🐸


## How do I participate?

The rules are more simple than you think!

1) Do something coding-related every day for 30 days.
2) Post your progress on Twitter or OPC.
3) Record the tweet or post in the [#30NitesOfCode dashboard](https://www.codedex.io/30-nites-of-code).

And that's it!
