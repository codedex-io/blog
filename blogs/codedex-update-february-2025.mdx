“If you build it, they will (eventually) come.”

February may have been just 28 days, but it was a record-breaking month on all fronts.

229,000 unique visitors came to our site last month. 🤯 

Between fundraising and keeping the site running (scaling up servers and juggling API limits & AI credits), it’s been a whirlwind. I’ll keep this intro short – read on.

#### ✅ Code Evaluation (Beta)

![Code Evaluation](https://i.imgur.com/DNi9Sbl.gif)

Code validation is a core feature that you all have been asking for. The traditional approach would take months, possibly a year, to retroactively add regex tests and output functions across the existing catalog. We launched a beta version to test out the accuracy.

#### 🦠 Node.js Course

We redesigned our Project Showcase to feel more like a showcase (switched to a gallery-style presentation that emphasized each project’s cover image while making it clear how to filter by project tags). Added Staff Picks, too!
