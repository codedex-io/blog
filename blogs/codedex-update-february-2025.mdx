_“If you build it, they will (eventually) come.”_

February may have been just 28 days, but it was a record-breaking month on all fronts.

229,000 unique visitors came to our site last month. 🤯 

Between fundraising and keeping the site running (scaling up servers and juggling API limits & AI credits), it’s been a whirlwind. I’ll keep this intro short – read on.

#### ✅ Code Evaluation (Beta)

![Code Evaluation](https://i.imgur.com/DNi9Sbl.gif)

Code validation is a core feature that y'all have been asking for. The traditional approach would take months, possibly a year, to retroactively add regex tests and output functions across the existing catalog. We launched a beta version to test out the accuracy.

#### 🦠 Node.js Course

![Node.js Course](https://i.imgur.com/hmSsAlw.gif)

Node.js isn’t a library – it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, like a food truck that lets a chef cook anywhere instead of just in a kitchen! Highest requested course. (This is also our first Club course.)

#### 🖼 Project Showcase

We redesigned our Project Showcase to feel more like a showcase (switched to a gallery-style presentation that emphasized each project’s cover image while making it clear how to filter by project tags). Added Staff Picks, too. Go and check out projects from the community!

#### 🏆 Leaderboards: Weekly vs. All Time

![Leaderboards page](https://i.imgur.com/XxKNWdM.png)

Leaderboards is an entirely new addition to our on-platform community! Now, you can see who has earned the most XP (gained by completing exercises and code challenges) to create more friendly competition. This is heavily inspired by video game leaderboards (i.e. Dota 2, League, Fortnite).

#### 🤓 Community Redesign

![Community Redesign blog](https://i.imgur.com/OFseIMe.png)

We redesigned our on-platform community aka the OPC! Take a look into our process, design decisions, and what’s to come. This is the first blog by Jackie, our product designer mastermind.
