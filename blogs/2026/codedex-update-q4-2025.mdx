Happy New Year, folks! 🥳

2025 was a breakout year for Codédex. After taking two weeks off to recharge, I wanted to share a recap of what we shipped and learned in Q4 2025 (October - December). 

Let's get into it.

## 👩‍🎤 Character Customization

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/SAssHWJ.gif)

Change your hair. Pick your fit. Choose your vibe. **Character customization is live!** 🎨

This has been one of our most requested features for years, and we finally shipped it. You can now personalize your Codédex character with 7 skin tones, 3 hairstyles x 10 colors, 4 outfits x 5 colors. That's **33,600 possible combinations** and it's just the start. This lays the foundation for microtransactions, item drops, and Club cosmetics. Read Dharma's [blog post](https://www.codedex.io/blog/customize-your-avatar-in-worlds) on it. 

Update your character today via User Dashboard → "Edit".

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}

## 🧚 Lumi - Full Page Experience

![Lumi Full Page GIF](https://i.imgur.com/s2pPB1k.gif)

Since introducing **Lumi**, our in‑course AI companion, on September 25th, something wild happened. In just three months, **Lumi answered 542,046 questions**! 🤯 That absolutely blew past our expectations. So we gave Lumi the space it deserved.

We launched a **full-page Lumi experience** and added:

- A dedicated Lumi landing page (when logged out / anon users)
- One-click access from the global **Practice** tab
- A left sidebar for saved conversation

## 💅 Redesigns, Redesigns, Redesigns

Q4 was about finishing what we started: migrating remaining pages to our new design system.

### User Profile Redesign

![user profile GIF](https://i.imgur.com/nHn2lLm.gif)

Imagine if Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub had a baby – and that baby learned tech skills. We redesigned Use Profiles to better showcase _you_ and moved your character, #30NitesOfCode pets, Achievement badges, Skills, Certificates to the right sidebar. Hope you like it!

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io/@sonny"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See new User Profile</Button>
  </a>
</div>

### Blog Redesign

![blog post redesign](https://i.imgur.com/WgQpuxQ.gif)

This one was overdue. We've been pumping out content more consistently – product updates, a day in the life, technical resources, etc. – and launching new serieses like Learner Stories, the blog needed some love. With the redesign, we shipped a cleaner reading experience, comments (yes, finally!), search and better navigation, support for block quotes and richer formatting.

We’re also opening the door for more community contributors ([Vishalya](https://www.codedex.io/blog/24-hours-at-hackutd-my-first-hackathon), [Sophie](https://www.codedex.io/blog/12-cool-coding-project-ideas-for-beginners), [Nick](https://www.codedex.io/blog/can-chatgpt-beat-my-favorite-puzzle-game)). If you’ve written posts in the OPC that performed well and want to guest write... DM me. 👀

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io/blog"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See new Blog page</Button>
  </a>
</div>

### Project Tutorial Redesign

![project tutorial redesign gif](https://i.imgur.com/8wR3pcv.gif)

Project tutorials also got a revamp to make the catalog feel less overwhelming with more visual heirachy. We updated the right sidebar as well as added a commenting system.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io/projects"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See new Project Tutorial page</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## 📈 Subscriber Retention

![subscriber retention](https://i.imgur.com/32aNM1l.gif)

As of Q4, **~60% of Clubbers stay sbuscribed after 3 months.** To anchor this, Disney+ & Hulu bundle's 3 month is 80% and Netflix is 74%. 

EdTech subscriptions tend to see much lower rention than media (Netflix) or traditional Saas (Zoom, Slack, Notion, GitHub) but some of the best retention products are games... classic MMO (WoW), live services (Roblox, Fornite), and mobile games (Clash Royal, Candy Crush). So if we are able to realize our vision of making learning more fun than playing your favorite game or watching your favorite movie, then we can definitely push higher as we optimize for _habit_.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7382431438110920705-P30S"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See example on LinkedIn</Button>
  </a>

## 🕹️ Game Jam 2025

We wrapped up the year by hosting our first‑ever Codédex [Game Jam](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/SyGFUPnD7myNHfEmzoJr). Coming off the launch of our new Game Dev courses (Lua, Phaser), we honestly didn’t know what to expect. What we got completely floored us. The creativity, storytelling, and _heart_ in these submissions were unreal.

🏆 **The winners were:**

- 🥇 **Best Overall:** [Trishul](https://www.codedex.io/blog/game-jam-2025-winners#-best-overall)
- 📖 **Best Storyteller:** [Before I Fade](https://www.codedex.io/blog/game-jam-2025-winners#-best-storytelling)
- 🎨 **Best Game Art:** [Closing Cleanup](https://www.codedex.io/blog/game-jam-2025-winners#-best-game-design--art)
- 🧩 **Best Puzzle:** [Between Timestamps](https://www.codedex.io/blog/game-jam-2025-winners#-best-puzzle)
- 🤠 **Best Action:** [Mr. Hat & The 5 Legendary Pieces of Chip](https://www.codedex.io/blog/game-jam-2025-winners#-best-action-adventure)

In 2026, we’ll be helping select winners produce game trailers and launch their titles! Psyched.

## 2026: The Year of Horse

We're rested and we're back. Full attack mode.

2026 is our year. We're starting by focusing on curriculum depth (finishing Pandas, ML, DSA, C++, Gen AI) and breadth (adding new courses like Matplotlib, C#, UI/UX). Once that foundation is locked in, we move into some very big opportunities later this year where we take the company to new heights. We have five major areas that no other companies are tackling that we want to bet on. It's not if, it's when. 

Lastly, it’s the Year of the Horse. And I’m a horse. That only comes around once every 12 years. 

It's my year, y'all. Time to run. ❤️‍🔥
