Happy New Year, folks! 🥳

2025 was a breakout year for Codédex. After taking two weeks off to recharge, I wanted to share a recap of what we shipped and learned in Q4 2025 (October - December). 

Let's get into it.

## 👩‍🎤 Character Customization

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/SAssHWJ.gif)

Change your hair. Pick your fit. Choose your vibe. Character customization is officially live! 🎨

People have been asking for this feature for years and we finally delivered. There are 7 skin tones, 3 hair styles x 10 colors, 4 outfit styles x 5 colors. That's **33,600 combinations**! This lays the foundation for microtransaction and exclusive items. Read Dharma's [blog post](https://www.codedex.io/blog/customize-your-avatar-in-worlds) on it. 

Update your character in the User Dashboard "Edit" today~

## 🧚 Lumi - Full Page Experience

![Lumi Full Page GIF](https://i.imgur.com/s2pPB1k.gif)

Since we introduced Lumi and revamped the in-course AI companion bot on September 25th, Lumi **answered 542,046 questions in the past three months**! 🤯 This blew away our expectations. So we launched a full paged dedicated view.

We included:

- Lumi Landing page when logged out
- Left sidebar for saved convos
- Easy access from the "Practice" global tab so you are one click away

🔖 Bookmark this page: https://www.codedex.io/lumi

## ⚙️ Redesigns, Redesigns, and Redesigns

### User Profile Redesigns

We knocked out the final remaining redesigns was the **/account** page. We’ve fixed a few UI/UX pitfalls – like entering full social URLs instead of slugs – and added improvements such as an easier way to switch between monthly and annual plans, email newsletter settings, and more!

## 📈 Subscriber Retention

![subscriber retention](https://i.imgur.com/32aNM1l.gif)

~60% of Clubbers stay sbuscribed after 3 months. 

EdTech subscriptions tend to see much lower rention than media (Netflix, or traditional Saas (Software as a Service) like Zoom, Slack, Notion, GitHub, etc. Duolingo and Codédex are the EdTech version of it.

Your resume, personal portfolio, and LinkedIn are always evolving, so be sure to add these certificates early in your learning journey!

  style={{
    display: "flex",

## 2025

![growth](https://i.imgur.com/ewNxW8t.jpeg)

We started the year with 250,000 registered users and today, we are at 1,250,000! **That's 1 million new users in just 9 months.** 2025 has been absolutely giving so far. 

As we tunnel-vision on retention in Q4, all the hard work is starting to pay off. We’re fighting asymmetrically against the incumbents who had a 10-year head start... and closing the gap.
