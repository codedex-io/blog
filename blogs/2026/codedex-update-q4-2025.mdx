Happy New Year! 🥳

2025 was a tremendous year for Codédex. We took a two weeks time off to recharge and reset for the new year. 

But let's go over what we did in Q4 2025.

Here’s a quick recap of everything we’ve released from October to December.

## 🔎 Character Customization

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/WxRVvfV.gif)

Right after the v1.0 launch, we rolled out global search! Over the past few months, many of you have asked for an easier way to **find friends** on Codédex – so we made it happen. Now, search is available right from the global header, accessible from any page outside the LE.

A search bar tends to bring a whole new layer of depth to a product, which I love~

You can now search across:

- 📚 Courses
- 📝 Project Tutorials
- 👤 Users

## 🪄 Meet Lumi - Full Page

![Lumi GIF](https://i.imgur.com/BUOGzzp.gif)

Since we introduced Lumi and launched the in-course on September 25th, Lumi answered 542,046 questions. 🤯 So we launched the full paged dedicated view in a UI familiar to ChatGPT and Gemini.

We included:

- Left sidebar for save conversations
- 


Say hello to **Lumi**, your new AI code companion! We completely revamped our AI feature and Lumi is now available in all courses (except those without a code editor). 🧚

Your AI chat history is saved for one week, so you can easily revisit past questions. Currently, Clubbers enjoy **unlimited questions**, while free users get 5 a day. Use them wisely!

To help you get started, we’ve also included these one-click prompts:

- ✨ Tell me more about this concept
- ✨ Provide step-by-step instructions
- ✨ Get feedback on your code

Bookmark this page! https://www.codedex.io/lumi

**Note:** You’ll unlock Lumi once you reach 500 XP.

## 🎓 Subscriber Retention

![certificats](https://i.imgur.com/uvH5tTW.png)

60% of Clubbers stay sbuscribed after 3 months. 

EdTech submscriptions tend to see much lower rention than media (Netflix, or traditional Saas (Software as a Service) like

Since we launched cerficates in August 2023 (see the [original blog post](https://www.codedex.io/blog/certificates)), we've issued over **6,100 course certificates** through Accredible. Internally, Naomi has been pushing for a visual refresh since so many people are sharing them on LinkedIn, and the original design no longer feels on-brand. So, Jackie worked her usual magic, and here are the new certificates for Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Java (new!).

Your resume, personal portfolio, and LinkedIn are always evolving, so be sure to add these certificates early in your learning journey!

## Growth

![growth](https://i.imgur.com/ewNxW8t.jpeg)

We started the year with 250,000 registered users and today, we are at 1,250,000! **That's 1 million new users in just 9 months.** 2025 has been absolutely giving so far. 

As we tunnel-vision on retention in Q4, all the hard work is starting to pay off. We’re fighting asymmetrically against the incumbents who had a 10-year head start... and closing the gap.

## First-Ever Team Onsite

![Picnic](https://i.imgur.com/wmXKAQu.png)

Dharma was in the U.S.! So we brought the whole team to NYC (Eric from Houston, Ellie from Chicago, Colin from Jersey) for the first time ever. Some of us had never met each other IRL!

We launched v1.0 together, had a team picnic in Prospect Park, went live on Instagram, recorded 2 episodes of Boba Talk, sang our hearts out at karaoke, and just [locked in](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOCEo-9DxF0) overall.

Take a look at some moments (and maybe cry with us 🥹):
