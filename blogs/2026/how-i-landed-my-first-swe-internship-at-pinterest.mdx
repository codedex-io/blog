The talk among today's CS students can be summed up in one word: **internships**. 

Scroll through LinkedIn, sit in on a lecture, or grab coffee with friends and the convo always circles back to the same questions. _Who’s recruiting?_ _Who got an offer?_ _Who just heard back?_

Internships have quietly become the currency of credibility in tech – especially in a down market.

I’m [Daniel Li](https://www.codedex.io/@realdanielli), a Computer Science & Engineering major at Ohio State University (not a "target school" for tech companies like FAANG) and I landed a **Summer 2026 Software Engineering internship at Pinterest** in San Francisco after hundreds of rejections. 🥲

In this blog post, I'll walk you through my application process, how I built strong resume signals without prior SWE experience, what I focused on when I decided to lock in, and strategies that actually made a difference.

Spoiler: it isn't Cluely.

## First Things First: Motivation

So what kicked off the grind? To be honest, I didn’t have a dramatic "aha" moment where everything suddenly clicked. Since high school, I’ve more or less understood that getting where I wanted to go would require being intentional. Having a brother like [Sonny](https://codedex.io/@sonny) helped too lol.

Watching older CS students on social media struggle with the job market with nothing beyond coursework made me realize that waiting until applications opened to start preparing was too late. I had to prep in the summer. That pushed me to focus more on learning and building things that showed how I think and work. Recruiters love this.

⏰ **Application Cycle (August - January):** Applications for top tech companies in SF, NYC, Seattle often open in August / September for the following summer. Offers by January.

And “locking in” wasn't about nonstop grinding and then on and off. It was about consistency. 

<Quote text="I wanted to use my time in college to slowly build skills, confidence, and evidence of work I could stand behind. That meant choosing personal projects carefully, saying yes to opportunities where I could learn quickly, and accepting that progress wouldn't be linear." />

Having that perspective made the process less stressful later. Instead of scrambling when recruiting season arrived, I could tell a clear story about what I’d built and why it mattered.

Even so, I took so many Ls before that one win. Here are my stats:

![My application numbers](https://i.imgur.com/Sfw8T9Z.png)
<Caption text="From 294 applications to 2 offers and 1 waitlist." />

## No Prior Experience

💡  The **"Experience Paradox"** is the vicious catch-22 in the job market where:

1. You need experience to get an internship.
2. You need an internship to get experience.

The classic meme in [r/ComputerScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience) is that even "entry-level" roles now ask for 2-3 years of experience and junior hiring has decreased by 22% due to AI and the broader downturn.

Breaking into tech is less about good grades (I didn't even list my GPA on the resume) and more about proving you can operate in real-world environments. This recruiting cycle, I was fortunate to receive multiple offers without any prior SWE internships. So how did I escape the paradox?

There are two easy ways to build resume value when you’re stuck in that loop.

### Undergrad Research as a Signal

The first is research. I started by lookinthg through my university’s [CS faculty pages](https://cse.osu.edu/directory/faculty) and reading about the work professors were doing. When something genuinely interested me, I reached out with a cold email referencing their research and explaining how I could contribute.

Research does two things well. First, it shows depth. Second, it signals that you can work on ambiguous, long-term problems. Whether it’s machine learning, computer vision, or systems, contributing meaningfully to a research project, especially one that leads to a publication or conference exposure, carries real weight in recruiting and graduate school admissions.

<Caption text="This is one of the cold emails I sent that got a yes." />

### Personal Projects That Actually Matter

The second is personal projects, which are almost non-negotiable in 2026 when applying to internships. A strong project answers a simple question: what problem does this solve, and why does it matter? You will most likely be asked about your projects in behavioral interviews, so it is important you actually know what you are building. Additionally, questions like “what was one time you faced a challenge” can be answered using experiences from projects.

Good projects demonstrate end-to-end ownership. That means design decisions, tradeoffs, failures, iteration, and measurable outcomes. I focused on building projects that used technologies relevant to the roles I was applying for and that I could confidently explain at a whiteboard. Wherever possible, I included metrics: scale, performance improvements, user impact, or data size. Numbers make projects real. 

Here are the three projects that are on my resume:

#### 1️⃣ Unveil: Community-Driven Product Ranking Platform

![unveil landing page](https://i.imgur.com/hal464v.gif)

I built an NLP-driven system that ingests, cleans, and analyzes 10K+ social media posts to rank products by frequency and sentiment. I designed the scoring algorithm myself, evaluated multiple sentiment approaches, and iterated to ~85% accuracy. I owned the full stack from data ingestion and model logic to a real-time, interactive frontend deployed for live use.

**Tools:** [Python](https://codedex.io/python), FastAPI, [Pandas](https://codedex.io/pandas), spaCy, [HTML](https://codedex.io/html), [CSS](https://codedex.io/css), [React](https://codedex.io/react), Netlify

    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}

    rel="noopener noreferrer"

</div>

#### 2️⃣ Economic Mobility Analytics Dashboard (Hackathon)

I helped design and build an end-to-end data pipeline to visualize economic mobility indicators across 11 Atlanta counties for CareerRise, a nonprofit. I made tradeoffs between data freshness and reliability when integrating Census and labor-market sources, and iterated on the visuals to balance interpretability with density. The final dashboard supported analysis over thousands of records and translated raw data into actionable heat maps for funding allocation.

**Tools:** [Python](https://codedex.io/python), [Pandas](https://codedex.io/pandas), [Plotly](https://plotly.com), [HTML](https://codedex.io/html), [CSS](https://codedex.io/css), [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com)

#### 3️⃣ Deal Sourcing Automation System

I automated an outbound sourcing workflow that identifies targets, generates tailored outreach, and sends emails at scale. I designed the database schema, implemented personalization logic across 100+ company profiles, and integrated an AI model to adapt tone and content by industry. Key tradeoffs included speed vs. personalization depth and API cost vs. output quality.

**Tools:** [Python](https://codedex.io/python), [SQLite](https://codedex.io/sql), SendGrid API, Mistral AI API

#### 👤 Portfolio Website

After I had three projects, I built a portfolio website to house them: https://danielli.tech

3 real-world projects + 1 one-page resume + 1 personal portfolio = solid. On to LeetCode!

## LeetCode: Boring But Necessary (Caveat)

There’s no way around it: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) still matters. At least in 2026.

I treated it more like a training session, kind of like how you might go to the gym to train your biceps. On average, I spent about 30–45 minutes a day, 4–5 days a week, consistently over several months. I focused less on raw problem count and more on pattern recognition: arrays, two pointers, stacks, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. At the end of high school, I had around 150 problems solved. During college, I had solved a hundred or so more.

I tracked my mistakes, revisited weak areas, and practiced explaining my thought process out loud. **Interviews reward clarity more than speed.** My mentor's advice: "Always keep talking. Even when you are stuck." A large part of the technical is to gauge how you approach problems.

On days when I was really tired from school or life, I'd switch things up and go on Codédex to make progress on [courses](https://codedex.io/courses) and [code challenges](https://www.codedex.io/challenges). No skipping leg days! 🔥

**Note:** A common mistake students typically make is focusing on practicing LeetCode problems when they aren’t even passing the resume screen for job postings. LeetCode is necessary, but only when your resume is strong enough to get those technical interviews. At the start, focus on building your resume and personal projects – later on is when you grind LeetCode.

## Hackathons and Real-World Pressure

One of the most impactful experiences for me was participating in [JPMorgan Chase's Code for Good 2025](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/careers/explore-opportunities/programs/tfsg-hackathons), an invitational hackathon supporting U.S. nonprofits. Hackathons like this simulate real engineering work far better than coursework. 

Code for Good forced me to think about requirements, tradeoffs, and delivery, as well as the scope of problems before hands touched keyboards. It also gave me concrete stories to tell in interviews about collaboration, ambiguity, and impact. 

That experience showed up repeatedly in recruiter conversations. Game-changer.

## Support Systems and Luck

None of this happens in isolation. I was lucky to have a strong support system around me throughout this process. My best friend, who was also recruiting, kept me accountable, shared resources, and was honest when something wasn’t working (we applied to hundreds of internships together). Also recruiters who took time to answer questions, review resumes, and explain what interviews actually looked like behind the scenes. 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒

Equally important was having people outside of tech who kept things in perspective. When recruiting didn’t go well or results were slow, that balance mattered more than I expected.

Luck also played a big role. Being ready when the right opportunity shows up is important, but opportunity still has to show up. Timing, company needs, resume reviewers, and even which recruiter reads your application can all influence outcomes in ways you can’t control. 🤞

What you can control is preparation and consistency. A good support system and some luck can amplify your efforts, but only if you’ve put in the groundwork beforehand.

## My Interview Process

For most reputable companies, the interview process starts with an **online assessment (OA)** that most commonly consists of [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.codedex.io/data-structures-and-algorithms) questions. For some companies, you need to score well on the OA for your resume to be considered. For others, the OA comes after your resume passed the screening and a good performance leads to an interview. 

Afterwards, you'll have to complete two types of interviews. The first type is **behavioral**, which evaluates your communication skills and workplace fit.

**Common questions asked are:**

- _Tell me about yourself._ 👈
- _Why do you want to work at [blank] company?_ 👈
- _Why software engineering? / Why CS?_
- _Tell me one challenge you faced and what you learned from it?_
- _Do you have any questions for me?_

My personal way to approach this interview is planning ahead for the first two questions since they are almost always asked. For the rest of the questions, I will have stories I can talk about for each of my experiences and projects that I can relate back to the goal of each question.

Not all companies will have **technical interviews**, but the majority of big tech will. This typically consists of a live 1:1 session with an engineer at the company, where you work through one or more problems in real time. These interviews are designed to evaluate how you break down ambiguous problems and communicate your thought process. 

Make sure to do a mock interview with a friend beforehand!

Out of 3 problems in my technical interview, I had only solved 2 but still passed. 😅

🗓️ **My Pinterest timeline:**

- **September 14th:** Applied the first day it was released.
- **October 1st:** Got OA.
- **October 24th:** Recruiter call (behavioral).
- **November 24th:** Final round (technical).
- **December 1st:** Recruiter wants to chat.
- **December 2nd:** Got the offer!

<Caption text="I put the recruiter on mute so I could scream. Everything was worth it." />

### Some Other Notes

Sonny asked if some other things played a role in my process, so I'm going to list it out (in order):

- **AI:** Played a major role. I have an OpenAI subscription and use it every day. 
- **Career Fairs:** Meh. Not guaranteed, but got one interview. More of a way to practice talking.
- **LinkedIn:** Not the most useful unless you're actively networking and seeking referrals.
- **CS Clubs:** Could be useful if you have a position or contribute to a project. More to meet ppl.
- **GPA:** After reaching a certain point, it won't really matter. Don't fail your classes though.

This is just my experience. I don't be Linkedin-maxxing anymore but it might work for others.

## Final Thoughts

Recruiting is filled with rejection, silence, and moments where it feels like everyone else is moving faster than you. What most people don’t see is the accumulation behind the scenes. Consistency compounds faster than luck.

You don’t need to follow the exact same path I did, but you do need a plan, patience, and the willingness to show up every day even when there’s no immediate reward. If you do that long enough, results tend to follow.

Best of luck guys!

P.S. Will write another blog post about my Pinterest experience after summer!
