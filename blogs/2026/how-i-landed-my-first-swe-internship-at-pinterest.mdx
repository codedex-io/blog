🚧 **Under construction. Check back tomorrow.** 🚧

The talk of today’s college students studying computer science and related fields can be summed up in one word: internships. Scroll through LinkedIn, sit in on any CS lecture, or grab coffee with friends, and the conversation almost always circles back to the same questions. Who’s recruiting? Who has an offer? Who just heard back? 

Internships have quietly become the currency of credibility in tech and a major catalyst for future career growth, especially during a down cycle in tech.

I’m a Computer Science & Engineering major at Ohio State University and I landed a Summer 2026 Software Engineering internship at Pinterest in San Francisco after getting rejected by hundreds of internships that I applied to.

In this blog post, I want to walk you through my application process, how I built a signal on my resume without prior SWE internships, and what I actually spent my time doing when I decided to grind.

## Motivation

So what was the thing that started the grind? To be honest, I didn’t have a dramatic turning point where everything suddenly clicked. I’ve more or less understood since high school that getting where I wanted to go whether in my career or anything in life would require being intentional.

I saw individuals on social media struggle through recruiting without much to point to beyond coursework, and I realized that waiting until applications opened to start preparing was already too late. That pushed me to focus less on titles and more on building things that showed how I think and work.

So “locking in” was more about being consistent rather than grinding nonstop or chasing prestige. I wanted to use my time in college to slowly build skills, confidence, and evidence of work I could stand behind. That meant choosing personal projects carefully, saying yes to opportunities where I could learn quickly, and accepting that progress would be uneven.

Having that perspective early made the process less stressful later. Instead of scrambling when recruiting season arrived, I could focus on telling a clear story about what I’d worked on and why it mattered.

## No Prior Experience

Breaking into tech today is less about getting good grades (I did not even have my GPA on my resume) and more about proving you can operate in real-world environments. At the same time, many internships prefer candidates with previous experience, even though the point of an internship is to gain experience in the first place. This recruiting cycle, I was fortunate enough to receive multiple offers without having any prior SWE internships on my resume.

There are two “easier” ways to build resume value when you’re stuck in that loop.

### Research as Signal

The first is research. I started by looking through my university’s CS faculty pages and reading about the work professors were doing. When something genuinely interested me, I reached out with a cold email referencing their research and explaining how I could contribute.

Research does two things well. First, it shows depth. Second, it signals that you can work on ambiguous, long-term problems. Whether it’s machine learning, computer vision, or systems, contributing meaningfully to a research project, especially one that leads to a publication or conference exposure, carries real weight in recruiting and graduate school admissions.

### Projects That Actually Matter

The second is personal projects, which are almost non-negotiable in 2026 when applying to internships. A strong project answers a simple question: what problem does this solve, and why does it matter? You will most likely be asked about your projects in behavioral interviews, so it is important you actually know what you are building. Additionally, questions like “what was one time you faced a challenge” can be answered using experiences from projects.

Good projects demonstrate end-to-end ownership. That means design decisions, tradeoffs, failures, iteration, and measurable outcomes. I focused on building projects that used technologies relevant to the roles I was applying for and that I could confidently explain at a whiteboard. Wherever possible, I included metrics: scale, performance improvements, user impact, or data size. Numbers make projects real. 

Here are the three projects that’s on my resume:

#### Economic Mobility Analytics Dashboard (Hackathon)
- I helped designed and build an end-to-end data pipeline to visualize economic mobility indicators across 11 Metro Atlanta counties for nonprofit decision-making. I made tradeoffs between data freshness and reliability when integrating Census and labor-market sources, and iterated on visual encodings to balance interpretability with density. The final dashboard supported analysis over thousands of records and translated raw data into actionable heat maps for funding allocation.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Plotly, HTML/CSS, Tableau

#### Unveil: Community-Driven Product Ranking Platform

- I built an NLP-driven system that ingests, cleans, and analyzes 10K+ social media posts to rank products by frequency and sentiment. I designed the scoring algorithm myself, evaluated multiple sentiment approaches, and iterated to reach ~85% accuracy. I owned the full stack from data ingestion and model logic to a real-time, interactive frontend deployed for live use.
- Tools: Python, FastAPI, spaCy, Pandas, React, HTML/CSS, Netlify

## Leetcode: Boring but Necessary Only When You Need It

There’s no way around it: LeetCode matters. 

I treated it more like a training session, kind of like how you might go to the gym to train your biceps. On average, I spent about 30–45 minutes a day, 4–5 days a week, consistently over several months. I focused less on raw problem count and more on pattern recognition: arrays, two pointers, stacks, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. At the end of high school, I had around 150 problems solved. During college, I had solved a hundred or so more.

I tracked mistakes, revisited weak areas, and made sure I could explain my thought process out loud. Interviews reward clarity more than speed. A good piece of advice I got from my mentor is that you should always try to be talking. Even when you are stuck, you should still communicate your reasoning out loud - a large part of technical interviews is to gauge how you approach problems.

A common mistake students typically make is focusing on completing Leetcode problems when they aren’t passing the resume screen for job postings. Leetcode is necessary, but only when your resume is strong enough to get those technical interviews. At the start, focus on building your resume - later on is when you grind Leetcode.

## Hackathons and Real-World Pressure

One of the most impactful experiences for me was participating in [JPMorgan Chase Code for Good](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/careers/explore-opportunities/programs/tfsg-hackathons), an invitational hackathon supporting nonprofits. Hackathons like this simulate real engineering far better than coursework. 

Code for Good forced me to think about requirements, tradeoffs, and delivery, as well as the scope of problems before hands touched keyboards. It also gave me concrete stories to tell in interviews about collaboration, ambiguity, and impact. That experience showed up repeatedly in recruiter conversations and interviews.

## Support Systems and Luck

None of this happens in isolation. I was lucky to have a strong support system around me throughout this process. My best friend who was also recruiting kept me accountable, shared resources, and was honest when something wasn’t working (we applied to hundreds of internships together). Recruiters who took time to answer questions, review resumes, and explain what interviews actually looked like behind the scenes. 

Equally important was having people outside of tech who kept things in perspective. When recruiting didn’t go well or results were slow, that balance mattered more than I expected.

Luck also played a big role. Being ready when the right opportunity shows up is important, but opportunity still has to show up. Timing, team needs, resume reviewers, and even which recruiter reads your application can all influence outcomes in ways you can’t control. Acknowledging that doesn’t diminish the work. It just keeps the process honest.

What you can control is preparation and consistency. A good support system and some luck can amplify your efforts, but only if you’ve put in the groundwork beforehand.

## Interview Process

For most reputable companies, the interview process starts with an online assessment (OA) that most commonly consists of data structures and algorithms questions. For some companies, you need to score good on the OA in order to have your resume considered. For other companies, the OA is the first step after your resume has passed the screening and a good performance leads to an interview. 

Afterwards, you will have to complete two types of interviews. The first type is behavioral, which evaluates your social capabilities and ensures that you won’t be a menace to the workplace. Common questions asked are:

- Tell me about yourself (have never not been asked this)
- Why do you want to work at X company 
- Tell me one challenge you faced and what you learned from it
- Do you have any questions for me

My personal way to approach this interview is planning ahead for the first two questions since they are almost always asked. For the rest of the questions, I will have stories I can talk about for each of my experiences and projects that I can relate back to the goal of each question.

Not all companies will have technical interviews, but the majority of big tech will. This typically consists of a live session with an engineer from the team you are applying to, where you work through one or more problems in real time. These interviews are designed to evaluate how you break down ambiguous problems and communicate your thought process. As an example, out of 3 problems in my technical interview, I had only solved 2 but still passed.

## Final Thoughts

Recruiting is filled with rejection, silence, and moments where it feels like everyone else is moving faster than you. What most people don’t see is the accumulation behind the scenes. Consistency compounds faster than luck.

You don’t need to follow the exact same path I did, but you do need a plan, patience, and the willingness to show up every day even when there’s no immediate reward. If you do that long enough, results tend to follow.

Best of luck.

## What was your goal when you first started?

When I started learning to code, my goal was simple: I wanted to build something of my own.

I was fascinated by how video games and software were made, and I wanted to understand how everything worked behind the scenes. At the time, I didn’t know where it would take me, I just knew I wanted a skill that could open doors and create a better future for myself.

## What were the biggest challenges?

One of my biggest challenges was simply not knowing where to start. After graduating, I didn’t have a clear roadmap or guidance. I didn’t take advantage of my school’s career resources, and I had family responsibilities that pulled me away from focusing on my own future. That left me feeling stuck working jobs I didn’t enjoy and unsure of how to break into tech. 

Another major point of friction was confidence. I knew how to code, but I didn’t feel “job ready.” I didn’t have projects, I didn’t have direction. And honestly, rejection played a role too. My first hackathon application was rejected, and moments like that made me question if I even belonged in tech. But that rejection actually pushed me to look elsewhere, which is how I found Codédex.


## So how did you overcome those?

I overcame those challenges by taking control of my situation one step at a time. When I didn’t know where to start, I gave myself the space to pause and plan. Working flexible jobs like Uber Eats and Amazon Flex allowed me to cover my responsibilities while still carving out time to focus on my future. That breathing room helped me rebuild my direction.

The biggest shift came when I found Codédex. Being part of a community where people were learning, sharing, and supporting each other gave me back the confidence I had lost. I started showing up to live workshops, hanging out in voice chats, doing mock interviews, and actually applying what I learned by building real-world projects. Little by little, my skills sharpened and my confidence grew. I also pushed myself to stay consistent. Even on days I felt unsure, I kept showing up writing code, asking questions, helping others. 

That consistency slowly turned into momentum. 💪🏾

## How did you stay motivated? Spill the tea!

I stayed motivated by reminding myself that I didn’t want to stay stuck in where I was. Every small step forward felt like progress toward a better life. Being part of the [Codédex community](https://codedex.io/community) also kept me going, seeing others learn and grow made me want to keep improving. And whenever I looked back at my early projects, it showed me how far I’d come, which pushed me to keep going.


## What’s the best part of your success?

The best part of my success is finally seeing the life I used to imagine start to become... real. 

I went from feeling stuck and uncertain to having a clear career, stability, and confidence in my abilities. What makes it even better is knowing I earned it through my own consistency and the support of a community that believed in me. It feels good to look at where I am now and realize that all the late nights, rejections, and hard decisions were worth it.

## If you could build one piece of fictional tech into reality, what would it be?

I’d bring JARVIS and the Iron Man robotic arm into reality. 

JARVIS because having an intelligent assistant that understands you, learns from you, and helps manage every part of your life would be game-changing. And the Iron Man arm because the idea of a fully responsive, high-tech mechanical limb you can control naturally is just incredible. 

Together, they'd feel like your personal lab, support system, and super upgrade all in one.

## Last one! What would you change at Codédex?

If I had a magic wand, I’d make Codédex the number one coding platform in the world. 🫶🏾

The team, the community, and the way they teach deserve global recognition. More people should experience the support, confidence, and opportunities that Codédex gave me.
