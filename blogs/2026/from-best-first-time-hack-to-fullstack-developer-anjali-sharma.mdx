## Tell us about yourself!

Hi, I’m [Anjali Sharma](https://codedex.io/@anjaliiish10844), born and raised in Agra, Uttar Pradesh (India). 

In school, I took a Computer Science class... but honestly, I never paid much attention to it. I studied CS only to pass the exam, without any real interest. But then something happened. 

During a 2-month school break, I stumbled upon a YouTube video “Build 20 Games with Python.” Out of curiosity, I followed along. To my surprise, I ended up building a game! That spark – the joy of creating something with code – lit a fire in me. That’s when I started exploring Computer Science seriously. I decided to pursue a Bachelor of Vocation in AI and Robotics. In my first semester, there wasn’t any coding in the syllabus, but I took the initiative to learn [Python](https://codedex.io/python) and built a few mini-projects. That boosted my confidence. 

The real turning point came when my best friend’s brother gave me one key piece of advice: “Pick one thing. Master it. You’ll find your way.” Taking that to heart, I tried to learn Django — but I struggled... I didn’t have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So I learned MERN stack, built projects, and finally felt like I belonged. 

💡 The **MERN** stack is a popular, open-source JavaScript framework for building dynamic, full-stack web applications, combining **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress.js, **R**eact, and **N**ode.js. 

## Heck yesss. What happened next?

Well, after my second year, I realized something was missing... I had no tech community, no hackathons, no real-world exposure. So I started networking, and then, a major turning point happened. While watching a coding reel on Instagram, I found Codédex’s Summer Hackathon and I signed up immediately. I created a Discord account, joined the Codédex server, found a hackathon teammate by luck, and together, we built a cool project overnight. 

And, guess what? We won "Best First-Time Hack"!! 

That moment was magical. It was my first coding win. I got my first swag, posted about it on LinkedIn, and made my family proud. It gave me belief. 

From there, everything changed. 

I started actively participating on Discord, building a solid network, and I met with incredible mentors like Sonny, Eric, and Dharma on the Codédex team. They reviewed my resume, guided me, and encouraged me. I started participating in [Monthly Challenges](https://codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge), won a Codédex hoodie for Halloween quizzes and GitHub PRs (11 PRs in Hacktoberfest!), and explored more hackathons. Even when my idea got shortlisted in the Amazon Sambhav Hackathon, exams held me back from finishing it — but I was proud of getting shortlisted. 

In my third year, I grinded hard. I built projects, collaborated with the community, improved my skills, and before college ended, **I secured a Fullstack Developer role in Noida!** 😭

But this is not the end. It’s just the beginning. I’m hungry for more. I want to learn, build, and share. I’ve gone from not knowing what coding really is to finding so much joy in it. I’m excited for what’s next!

## What was your favorite project to date?

It has to be my personal portfolio! I built it with [React](https://codedex.io/react), Three.js, and React Three Fiber as an evolution of an [earlier 3D portfolio](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/BI3sKp7RZgOSWDxfmfsx
). I’ve always wanted a site that felt unique, and since I had experience with 3D modeling, combining that with web development felt like a natural direction.

It took about two weeks to complete, and it represents a turning point where I began intentionally blending 3D and web dev. While I’m proud of the result, I see it as a foundation. I’m actively working on a more advanced version. Will share when it’s completed. 🫡

## What was your goal when you first started?

To be honest, when I first started coding, it was just because I had heard people say, “Learn coding, and you'll get a high-paying job.” That was my initial motivation. 💸

But once I actually started doing it — writing code, building small projects — my perspective completely changed. I began to realize how fascinating it is to create things from scratch. The websites and apps I had used during my childhood — I was now beginning to understand how they were actually made. That feeling of turning an idea into something real and interactive — it felt magical. 

That’s when I stopped thinking about just jobs or salaries. I started seeing coding as a superpower, a way to bring ideas to life.

## What were the biggest challenges?

One of the biggest challenges I faced was trying to learn everything at once. 

In my first year, I jumped from Django to Node.js to React, thinking I needed to master all of them to succeed. But in reality, I ended up spreading myself too thin. That year, I was just exploring without direction — and I now realize how much time I lost by not focusing deeply on one thing. It took me time to understand that you can't master everything. You just need to master one thing well enough to build and grow from there. 

Another ongoing challenge for me is consistency. There are days when I lose momentum, skip coding, or feel like I’m falling behind. And that inconsistency used to feel like a huge setback.

![setback](https://i.imgur.com/1MHpgmS.png)

## So how did you overcome those?

I overcame these challenges by finally committing to one path – I chose to focus on the MERN stack and dedicated myself to truly understanding and practicing it. Instead of jumping between technologies, I gave my full attention to mastering it step by step. 

To tackle inconsistency, I created a structured routine. I made it a point to code... Every. Single. Day. Even if it was just writing one line. That daily habit, no matter how small, helped me stay consistent and built the discipline I needed to grow steadily.

## How did you stay motivated? Spill the tea!

I stay motivated by always reminding myself why I started. Honestly, coding is something I genuinely enjoy — it never feels boring or like a chore. Every time I sit down to code, it feels exciting and fun. That passion keeps me going, even on the tough days.

## What’s the best part of your success?

One of the best parts of my journey was moving to a new city all by myself for the very first time. 

It was a completely new experience – living independently, exploring a different environment, learning new tech stacks, and working on real-world projects. Being part of an office culture was eye-opening, and the people I worked with were incredibly supportive and inspiring. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow both personally and professionally.

## What advice would you give to a code newbie? 

Just start, keep going, and never stop. You don’t need to be perfect — just consistent. Over time, you’ll become a multi-skilled version of yourself, someone who stands out among millions. Remember, it’s incredibly creative and fulfilling to build something that solves real-world problems through automation. 

Pick any tech stack you enjoy — but stay curious, keep updating your skills with evolving technologies. Most importantly, enjoy the process. Be consistent. Master what you learn. Apply it in real-world scenarios. Join hackathons. Build your community. Explore. Experiment. Grow. Because that’s how you evolve — not just as a developer, but as a creator and problem solver.

## Last one! What would you change at Codédex?

If I had magic, I’d just create the perfect job requirement myself, highlight all my skills in bold among millions... and boom, you’d have no choice but to hire me! Hehe. 🙃

On a real note though: You guys are truly awesome! I’ve genuinely fallen in love with the Codédex platform. from the learning experience to the amazing community to the playful props. 

Huge love and a massive thank you to the entire team. 💕
