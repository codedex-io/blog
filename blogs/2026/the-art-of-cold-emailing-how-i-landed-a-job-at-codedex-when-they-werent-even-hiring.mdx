Hey, it’s [Gabby](https://www.codedex.io/@gabtot) from Codédex on the Curriculum & Marketing team!

There’s one thing I’ve been asked A LOT in the past few months, so I’m here to answer the age old question: **How did you become a Codédex intern?** 

A lot of you have been asking me how I got here, and Sonny thought it would be cool if I shared what got me the role – even when Codédex wasn’t hiring! Let's dive in.

> I’d like to preface by saying if you want to work at Codédex solely for the sake of having a job to put on your resume, working here is not a good fit for you – please don’t email! The team gets a lot of spam and it would save both you and them the trouble! But you can 100% use the advice in this blog to craft a perfect email for the company of your dreams.

## Humble Beginnings

### A Little Background on My Career Path (??? - 2025)

![Pre-Codedex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/blog/refs/heads/main/blog-images/the-art-of-cold-emailing-how-i-landed-a-job-at-codedex-when-they-werent-even-hiring/pre-codedex.png)

**I have always, always, always wanted to work in the intersection of education and technology.** But it never seemed like a viable path because teachers are severely underpaid, and there aren’t a lot of EdTech companies compared to other sectors of tech. 

Over the last 8 years, I did a handful of education-focused gigs – I taught girls how to make iOS apps through [Kode with Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com), I taught preschoolers Scratch and robotics, and I gave museum tours on technology history. I even [founded a nonprofit](https://www.instagram.com/sayhellooworld) in high school that laid on the foundation of computer science + social good education. All of these jobs were really enjoyable, but I never really considered going along this path beyond temporary positions because the options to do so were very limiting. It didn’t feel possible, so it was just never in the picture.

As a Computer Science intended major since middle school, big tech was always the goal post-grad. But after two summers Software-Engineer-interning at big companies, I realized I didn’t feel as passionate about it as I thought I would. The work I competed didn’t feel meaningful, and I learned I didn’t like "enterprise coding" all that much. Most importantly, I did not feel valued by the teams I worked on. 

This is also around the time I changed majors from Computer Science to Design. I liked doing a lot of different types of work, but I didn’t really know what to do with that. I had a mid-collegiate crisis, and literally considered selling stickers at conventions full time. Until one day, it hit me: why not look into startups? 

Startups seemed like a good fit because you get to wear lots of different hats, create visible impact, and contribute to the company’s work meaningfully. You’ll never guess which startup was top of mind…

### How I Found Codédex (March 2024 - March 2025)

![Partiful RSVP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/blog/refs/heads/main/blog-images/the-art-of-cold-emailing-how-i-landed-a-job-at-codedex-when-they-werent-even-hiring/partiful-rsvp.png)

In March 2024, Codédex was hosting their first in-person meetup in NYC: a [Gen Z women in tech meetup](https://partiful.com/e/wTmS0muHPG6Mj1rGRif9)! I just so happened to be in Brooklyn for a few weeks, cat sitting. I found the link in a Slack I was in, RSVPed, and was on a waitlist of 20 people, so I didn’t even expect to go. I got off the day of and went spontaneously.

I’ve been to a lot of tech events, and this one was top tier: free boba, onigiri, LinkedIn headshots, goodie bags, networking that didn’t feel icky, handwritten thank you notes, and enthusiastic organizers (I met Naomi, Lil, and Sonny!). They even tagged me in their [event recap post](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5HIxZdgMyo). The thoughtfulness of just that event alone stuck with me, and I kept up with Codédex over the next year. (Funnily enough, I was also connected with Ellie for a couple of years, but didn’t realize she worked here!) 

I had some plans career wise, but they weren’t resonating with me. I wanted to try something new that would help me grow professionally. When I started thinking of startups I’d want to work at, I thought of Codédex first. But what was I actually supposed to do with that desire when I didn’t have a plan?

It's time to reach out! 💪

## The Cold Email

### Prep

Whoa, preparing to write a single email? Is it really that deep? Short answer: lowkey, yes. 

For a few days, I *inhaled* Codédex to make sure I got everything right. I explored every inch of the website and scrolled through hundreds of [social media posts](https://www.instagram.com/codedex.io). I learned the aesthetic. The branding. What the team regularly built. What learners enjoyed consuming. What I felt was missing. What I felt I could do to help make it better. 

Knowing how the company speaks, customer facing, is most important out of all these observations. It’ll influence the voice of your email. Read how they talk on social media, in public announcements or blog posts, in the about section of their website. If you feel too stiff and formal while the company is laid back and fun, they won’t think you’re a good fit. 

Asiqur joked the other day that when he read my email, he felt like I knew the company better than he did. I did my job right. 😤

## Who and Where to Contact

One of my first bosses, [Avni](https://www.instagram.com/avnibarman_/?hl=en), gives a lot of career advice and has always emphasized the power of a cold email. It’s gotten her partnerships, sponsorships, jobs, and countless opportunities. 

It was a little bold, but I wanted to take my request to the person with the most power to make a decision: the CEO. (I personally don’t think this makes sense if the team team you’re emailing is 100+ people, though.) I picked emailing over LinkedIn, because founders are always checking their emails, and might not even use LinkedIn at all. 

Here is the email, dissected:


## Subject Line

Startup employees get A LOT of emails. Out of that already large pool, they get SOOO much hiring asks. I had to strategize: *what are they most likely to prioritize?*

![subject](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codedex-io/blog/refs/heads/main/blog-images/the-art-of-cold-emailing-how-i-landed-a-job-at-codedex-when-they-werent-even-hiring/subject-line.png)
<Caption text="Short and sweet." />

The only goal of the subject line (title of the email) is to get them to open the email.

I picked something generic enough to sound like it could be coming from a colleague or partnership, so that it had a higher chance of being opened. Startups primarily focus on the people they already collaborate with, and this was vague enough that it could be from anyone in their immediate circle. 

Also, it feels clickbaity. I love being clickbaity.

## Introduction

![Introduction](https://i.imgur.com/W2hr1qT.png)

I know you’ll feel inclined to write a lot in this part in hopes of selling yourself, but it’s best to keep this part to literally *one sentence*. Who you are, what you do, where you are at, the stage of your life you’re currently at, and what you specifically work on. Instant credibility.

Additionally, if you’ve met them in some capacity previously, make sure to make a callback to that interaction. It’ll let them know you’ve been invested in them for some time, and are actually interested. Alternatively, if you were introduced to the company through someone who knows the team well, you can reference them in your email – that mutual can put in a good word if asked about you!

## Get Personal

![adhd](https://i.imgur.com/vGDzVL1.png)

What differentiates a bad cold email from a stellar one is when it’s too generic and not personal. If you’re not specific about why the company is significant to you, they will feel like you just want a job. You could try sliding in an anecdote like this:

Don’t specifically mention wanting a job (yet), but talk about why this company resonates with you or how it connects to your life. If you use their product a lot, talk about how that changed your life. Like I mentioned earlier and in the email, education is **extremely** **personal to me**, and I’ve always wanted to do something about making it better for other people. Be authentic, and try to make it sound unique to you. Get the reader invested.

## The Ask

One time, I danced around asking someone for a job referral for 20 minutes, and did not get the referral. 💀 Ask outright – be confident and assured! 

Here's my ask. **Bolded** and <u>underlined</u> so it's clear:

![the ask](https://i.imgur.com/KdgUoR6.png)

Like I mentioned, I wanted to build something meaningful, and knew that the team would be similarly aligned in that aspect. It also leans a little bit into why I want to work at a startup rather than somewhere else, and shows awareness that I know what Codédex stands for: educational impact.

## Mini Elevator Pitch

You can’t exactly summarize your resume, because resumes get pretty long, and we want to keep this email concise. 

I was lucky to have previous experience with brands that were familiar. Be sure to emphasize companies and organizations that will ring a bell. If you feel like you haven’t worked with any, you can think clubs, ambassador programs, or projects connected to companies. You can also cite numbers or statistics — for example, I mentioned leading a startup at 19 years old. 

I also highlighted that I’m flexible, since startups like to place people in niche places for specific needs. I was ready for anything, and I wanted to try everything. Make sure the experience you mention is aligned with what the company might need behind the scenes. For example, a company might not host community events like Codédex, so in that case it’s not really necessary to mention community involvement.

## Because you can't fit everything...
If you wanted to say more, links highlighting your achievements and involvement are a nice add on.

It signals that the read is optional, but that it provides more information about yourself if the company wants to know more about you. It’s a nice little “*juuust in case you were extra interested~”* Julien and I’s first convo happened to be about things I did that he read in my portfolio! 

End on a call to action:

- “Let me know if this is possible!”
- “Would you be free to hop on a call to talk further?”
- “Would love to be kept in the loop!”

## Adding value
**You need to show how a company hiring is not just beneficial for you, but also for them.** Doing this could end up being a lot of work (researching, coming up with ideas, etc.), but this is why I recommend reaching out to a small number of companies you really resonate with, instead of sending the same generic email to over 100 companies. 

To further hone in on my interest, I made a list of sample tasks I could do for Codédex specifically. It demonstrates initiative, and shows how serious you are. This is where studying up on the brand comes in handy, because it shows you know their product, and that you have a sense of how the company runs.

## Closing

Optional, but adding an email signature feels extra professional! There are lots of templates online to build one, but you can just make one with fonts you like in Google Docs and paste them in your email app. 

## Get a second pair of eyes to look it over
I asked three people if anything sounded too outlandish or if there were any grammatical mistakes. Your email might look perfect to you, but you can’t be too careful! 

## Timing
People are most active on their emails first thing in the morning and around after lunch, so I sent mine around then so it would be at the top of Sonny’s inbox. Then I proceeded to panic. I really wanted to work here!

## If they don't answer
Don’t forget to follow up once or twice, 2-5 days apart! Sometimes, people with hiring power really like you but get buried in their work and forget to answer. Next steps often land in the follow up emails.

Don’t be pushy!

Unfortunately for me, Sonny said the team wouldn’t be able to at the moment for budget reasons, but that they’d have more clarity when they finished fundraising. 

Unfortunately for Sonny, I don’t take no for an answer 🤪

## Cold Email: The Sequel
I spent the next month building things for Codédex, even if they didn’t ask it. I didn’t want to spam emails, but I was going to do everything in my power to get a yes. I kept an eye on any news about fundraising, so that once the budget expanded, I was ready to jump. 

### Adding MORE Value
I wanted the team to see that I had the skills to match their vision and their voice, and further show initiative. I made:

- An MVP (minimum viable product) avatar builder, so users can customize their sprites on Codédex. (This actually exists now btw, courtesy of the product team. Try it out!)
- Cheatsheets - Codédex already had cheatsheets, but some courses didn’t have any. I also wanted them to be more on brand than the original ones that they had, because they didn’t *feel* like Codédex.

Additionally, I offered to help run the startup series, where Codédex films startup office tours. I was going to a lot of startups through a program I was in called [hackNY](https://hackny.org/)! 

In Sonny's keynote speech at HackUTD, he mentioned that this is actually winner, by going completely over the top 12/10 by doing the work before.

**Note:** Both [Avatar Builder](https://www.codedex.io/blog/customize-your-avatar-in-worlds) AND [Cheatsheets](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOjW3_cj-ag/?img_index=1) are now Codédex features.

### Highlighting Urgency (In My Case)

At this point, I was in communication with other companies, but Codédex was still my number one priority. I needed to figure out plans sooner rather than later, so I emphasized that I needed clarity as soon as possible. 

I’ve heard some people say that saying that you have options will make companies want you more, even if it’s not true. Do this at your own risk. 🤷‍♀️

Whew! And the rest is history:

## Some General Tips...

- **Have the audacity, and be delusional.** Own your qualifications and experience, but don’t showboat it. Let your mind think as if you got the job. At risk of sounding harsh: If you don’t believe in yourself, why should a company?
- **Keep it as short as possible.** People these days hate reading, but even if they didn’t, startup employees specifically literally do not have the time to read that many things. If you can sell yourself and why you’re a fit in a singular paragraph, that’s a win.
- **Text format, for the skimmers.** Sometimes, unfortunately, people ain’t reading all that. If you caught on, I took advantage of bolding, italicizing, and underlining important phrases and words for clarity, reading efficiency, and emphasis.
- **Know your worth.** If a company is offering rates that aren’t sustainable (or are asking you to work for free), you should take your talents elsewhere. Getting a job is really hard these days, but working for less than you should be will burn you out and make it hard for you to get quality work done.
- **Don’t write it with AI.** Especially if they’re a tech company... they’ll know. Seriously.

Lastly, don’t be afraid to shoot your shot. You might anticipate getting ghosted or rejected, but you only need one yes from a company that you already confidently *know* is a fit. Obviously, landing this role wasn’t guaranteed (especially in this job market 😭) but I am truly so so grateful that everything panned out the way that it did. The team is amazing, and so is the work I’m doing. I really can’t imagine working anywhere else. 

I’d love to hear any success stories, things that surprised you, or any questions! Comment if any of these strategies work for you, any tips for outreach, and know that the Codédex team is rooting for your career growth - who knows, maybe your next email will land you a gig here 😉
