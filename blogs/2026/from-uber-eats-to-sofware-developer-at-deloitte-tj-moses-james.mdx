## Tell us about yourself!

Hi, I’m [Temitope “TJ” Moses James](https://codedex.io/@teejay) – a **Solutions Analyst / Software Developer** at Deloitte and someone who’s always chasing the next version of myself.

Growing up, my dream was to become a pilot. My first time flying had me hooked instantly, the engines, the lift, the whole idea of being thousands of feet in the sky. But when I got older and realized how expensive pilot training was, I had to face reality. I couldn’t afford that path, at least not yet. Still, I didn’t let go of that curiosity. I just redirected it. 

<Quote text="Codédex helped reignite my passion for coding after the Holiday Hackathon. Since then, I have connected with people who share similar interests as I do. The community feels like home. Full credit to this platform on landing my first tech job!" />

Video games became my next fascination. I wanted to know how they were made, so I started watching YouTube tutorials and experimenting on my own. That pulled me straight into programming. It was the first time I felt like, “Okay, this is something I can actually learn and build a future with.” That pushed me to study Computer Systems Technology at New York City College of Technology, where I built a solid foundation in software development.

But, graduating didn’t automatically unlock a career. I had family responsibilities, didn’t take advantage of career resources, and ended up working jobs I didn’t enjoy. I quit my office assistant job because it drained me, and I refused to fall back into retail, not after earning a degree. So I picked up flexible side gigs like Uber Eats and Amazon Flex, which gave me the time and space to re-evaluate my path. 

My real turning point was discovering Codédex.

## Wait, say more! We love compliments.

So I had applied to a hackathon through my school and got rejected. Then I found Codédex’s hackathon on Meetup, and that’s where everything shifted. My team won Best First-Time Hack, and that came with free [Club membership](https://codedex.io/pricing). That membership opened the door to web development, real projects, mock interviews, resume help, and most importantly, a [community](https://codedex.io/community) where I felt accepted. I didn’t have to pretend or put on a persona. I fit right in.

That environment helped me grow fast. I became active every day, learning, building, helping others, and slowly transforming my confidence and skills. I joined in December 2023, applied to Deloitte around that same time, and six months later… I got the interview and I nailed it. In September 2024, I celebrated my first year at Deloitte. And honestly, that was a major milestone for me. I accomplished one of my biggest career goals: becoming a software developer in a tough market, coming from a point where I had no clear direction.

And now? I’m aiming for the next one. I still want to get closer to that childhood dream, whether that means getting my pilot’s license someday, working in aviation tech, or combining my love for flying with my love for building things. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, but I’m also hungry for what’s next. I’m still that kid who looks up at the sky in awe. The only difference is now I’m building the tools and the career that will eventually get me closer to touching it.


## What was your favorite project to date?

It has to be my personal portfolio! I built it with [React](https://codedex.io/react), Three.js, and React Three Fiber as an evolution of an [earlier 3D portfolio](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/BI3sKp7RZgOSWDxfmfsx
). I’ve always wanted a site that felt unique, and since I had experience with 3D modeling, combining that with web development felt like a natural direction.

It took about two weeks to complete, and it represents a turning point where I began intentionally blending 3D and web dev. While I’m proud of the result, I see it as a foundation. I’m actively working on a more advanced version. Will share when it’s completed. 🫡

## What was your goal when you first started?

When I started learning to code, my goal was simple: I wanted to build something of my own.

I was fascinated by how video games and software were made, and I wanted to understand how everything worked behind the scenes. At the time, I didn’t know where it would take me, I just knew I wanted a skill that could open doors and create a better future for myself.

<Caption text="My offer letter! One of the best moments of my life." />

## What were the biggest challenges?

One of my biggest challenges was simply not knowing where to start. After graduating, I didn’t have a clear roadmap or guidance. I didn’t take advantage of my school’s career resources, and I had family responsibilities that pulled me away from focusing on my own future. That left me feeling stuck working jobs I didn’t enjoy and unsure of how to break into tech. 

Another major point of friction was confidence. I knew how to code, but I didn’t feel “job ready.” I didn’t have projects, I didn’t have direction. And honestly, rejection played a role too. My first hackathon application was rejected, and moments like that made me question if I even belonged in tech. But that rejection actually pushed me to look elsewhere, which is how I found Codédex.


## So how did you overcome those?

I overcame those challenges by taking control of my situation one step at a time. When I didn’t know where to start, I gave myself the space to pause and plan. Working flexible jobs like Uber Eats and Amazon Flex allowed me to cover my responsibilities while still carving out time to focus on my future. That breathing room helped me rebuild my direction.

The biggest shift came when I found Codédex. Being part of a community where people were learning, sharing, and supporting each other gave me back the confidence I had lost. I started showing up to live workshops, hanging out in voice chats, doing mock interviews, and actually applying what I learned by building real-world projects. Little by little, my skills sharpened and my confidence grew. I also pushed myself to stay consistent. Even on days I felt unsure, I kept showing up writing code, asking questions, helping others. 

That consistency slowly turned into momentum. 💪🏾

## How did you stay motivated? Spill the tea!

I stayed motivated by reminding myself that I didn’t want to stay stuck in where I was. Every small step forward felt like progress toward a better life. Being part of the [Codédex community](https://codedex.io/community) also kept me going, seeing others learn and grow made me want to keep improving. And whenever I looked back at my early projects, it showed me how far I’d come, which pushed me to keep going.


## What’s the best part of your success?

The best part of my success is finally seeing the life I used to imagine start to become... real. 

I went from feeling stuck and uncertain to having a clear career, stability, and confidence in my abilities. What makes it even better is knowing I earned it through my own consistency and the support of a community that believed in me. It feels good to look at where I am now and realize that all the late nights, rejections, and hard decisions were worth it.

## If you could build one piece of fictional tech into reality, what would it be?

I’d bring JARVIS and the Iron Man robotic arm into reality. 

JARVIS because having an intelligent assistant that understands you, learns from you, and helps manage every part of your life would be game-changing. And the Iron Man arm because the idea of a fully responsive, high-tech mechanical limb you can control naturally is just incredible. 

Together, they'd feel like your personal lab, support system, and super upgrade all in one.

## Last one! What would you change at Codédex?

If I had a magic wand, I’d make Codédex the number one coding platform in the world. 🫶🏾

The team, the community, and the way they teach deserve global recognition. More people should experience the support, confidence, and opportunities that Codédex gave me.
