_“My first\-ever solo trip, in Lucerne, Switzerland. I had never left the country by myself. And for the first time, I could not only do it, but completely rely on my wallet, thanks to my internship!”_

## Tell us about yourself!

Hi, I’m Temitope “TJ” Moses James – a Solutions Analyst / Software Developer at Deloitte and someone who’s always chasing the next version of myself.

Growing up, my dream was to become a pilot. My first time flying had me hooked instantly, the engines, the lift, the whole idea of being thousands of feet in the sky. But when I got older and realized how expensive pilot training was, I had to face reality. I couldn’t afford that path, at least not yet. Still, I didn’t let go of that curiosity. I just redirected it. Video games became my next fascination. I wanted to know how they were made, so I started watching YouTube tutorials and experimenting on my own. That pulled me straight into programming. It was the first time I felt like, “Okay, this is something I can actually learn and build a future with.” That pushed me to study Computer Systems Technology at New York City College of Technology, where I built a solid foundation in software development.

But, graduating didn’t automatically unlock a career. I had family responsibilities, didn’t take advantage of career resources, and ended up working jobs I didn’t enjoy. I quit my office assistant job because it drained me, and I refused to fall back into retail, not after earning a degree. So I picked up flexible side gigs like Uber Eats and Amazon Flex, which gave me the time and space to re-evaluate my path. My real turning point was discovering Codédex.

I had applied to a hackathon through my school and got rejected. Then I found Codedex’s hackathon on Meetup, and that’s where everything shifted. My team won Best First-Time Hack, and that came with free [Club membership](https://codedex.io/pricing). That membership opened the door to web development, real projects, mock interviews, resume help, and most importantly, a community where I felt accepted. I didn’t have to pretend or put on a persona. I fit right in.

That environment helped me grow fast. I became active every day, learning, building, helping others, and slowly transforming my confidence and skills. I joined in December 2023, applied to Deloitte around that same time, and six months later… I got the interview and I nailed it. In September 2024, I celebrated my first year at Deloitte. And honestly, that was a major milestone for me. I accomplished one of my biggest career goals: becoming a software developer in a tough market, coming from a point where I had no clear direction.

And now? I’m aiming for the next one. I still want to get closer to that childhood dream, whether that means getting my pilot’s license someday, working in aviation tech, or combining my love for flying with my love for building things. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, but I’m also hungry for what’s next. I’m still that kid who looks up at the sky in awe. The only difference is now I’m building the tools and the career that will eventually get me closer to touching it.

## What was your goal when you started learning coding?

When I first started learning to code, my goal was simple: I wanted to build something of my own.

I was fascinated by how video games and software were made, and I wanted to understand how everything worked behind the scenes. At the time, I didn’t know where it would take me, I just knew I wanted a skill that could open doors and create a better future for myself.

## What were your biggest challenges?

One of my biggest challenges was simply not knowing where to start. After graduating, I didn’t have a clear roadmap or guidance. I didn’t take advantage of my school’s career resources, and I had family responsibilities that pulled me away from focusing on my own future. That left me feeling stuck working jobs I didn’t enjoy and unsure [of] how to break into tech. Another major point of friction was confidence. I knew how to code, but I didn’t feel “job ready.” I didn’t have projects, I didn’t have direction. And honestly, rejection played a role too. My first hackathon application was rejected, and moments like that made me question if I even belonged in tech. But that rejection actually pushed me to look elsewhere, which is how I found Codédex.

## How did you overcome your challenges?

I overcame those challenges by taking control of my situation one step at a time. When I didn’t know where to start, I gave myself the space to pause and plan. Working flexible jobs like Uber Eats and Amazon Flex allowed me to cover my responsibilities while still carving out time to focus on my future. That breathing room helped me rebuild my direction.

The biggest shift came when I found Codedex. Being part of a community where people were learning, sharing, and supporting each other gave me back the confidence I had lost. I started showing up to workshops, hanging out in voice chats, doing mock interviews, and actually applying what I learned by building real projects. Little by little, my skills sharpened and my confidence grew. I also pushed myself to stay consistent. Even on days I felt unsure, I kept showing up writing code, asking questions, helping others. That consistency slowly turned into momentum.

## How did you stay motivated?

I stayed motivated by reminding myself that I didn’t want to stay stuck [in] where I was. Every small step forward felt like progress toward a better life. Being part of the Codedex community also kept me going, seeing others learn and grow made me want to keep improving. And whenever I looked back at my early projects, it showed me how far I’d come, which pushed me to keep going.

## What’s the best part of your success?

The best part of my success is finally seeing the life I used to imagine start to become real. I went from feeling stuck and uncertain to having a clear career, stability, and confidence in my abilities. What makes it even better is knowing I earned it through my own consistency and the support of a community that believed in me. It feels good to look at where I am now and realize that all the late nights, rejections, and hard decisions were worth it.

## If you could say anything to Codédex, what would you say?

If I had a magic wand, I’d make Codédex the number one coding platform in the world. The team, the community, and the way they teach deserve global recognition. More people should experience the support, confidence, and opportunities that Codédex gave me.

## Last Words for TJ

Hi Alan, your story is legendary. We still remember reviewing your "Back to NASA" Holiday Hackathon project like it was yesterday. It stood out not just as a brilliant mashup of _Back to the Future_, NASA, and early web nostalia, but because it had **heart**.

Now that we know your story, everything makes sense now. You’ve come so far, so fast (in record time), and it’s nothing short of amazing. Beyond proud of you.

Thank **YOU** for reverse-inspiring us and changing our lives, too.

\- Sonny

P.S. Here's Alan with Ellie & Brandon from Curriculum team in 2024, at the start of his journey.

Today, I’m one year into my internship, nearly finished with my degree, and full of new opportunities. Last year, I was selected as a Global Nominee at NASA Space Apps Zurich, and this year I had the honor of being a speaker at [NASA Space Apps Lucerne in Switzerland](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nasa-space-apps-challenge-lucerne-switzerland).

And so much more is coming. 💪

But everything traces back to the exact moment I started coding on Codédex. So yes, it might sound cliché, but I can safely say that Codédex is the reason I’m a developer today. Thank you.

_My first ever speech! In front of 50 people. How to prepare before and during a hackathon._

## What was your goal when you first started?

When I started learning to code, my goal wasn’t to become a developer. I just wanted to find my place in the world. I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere, and I hoped coding would help me discover what I was meant to do. It turned out to be the passion I had been searching for!

## Nice. What was your biggest challenge in reaching that? How did you overcome them?

My biggest challenge was **time**. I was working full-time, and by the time I got home, I was exhausted. Staying consistent and keeping up with learning wasn’t easy. Another friction point was simply not knowing where to start; what tools to use, which language to learn first, and what direction to follow. Everything felt overwhelming at the beginning.

I pushed through by being extremely consistent. Even when I came home exhausted, I’d try to learn just a little bit every day. I used every free moment I had: breaks, slow days at work, evenings, to keep progressing. Finding Codédex really helped me overcome the confusion of “where do I start?” The courses and community gave me structure, motivation, and a sense of belonging, which kept me moving forward when things got difficult.

_“\[This is] me focusing on coding during a workshop, not even listening.”_

## How did you stay motivated throughout?

I stayed motivated by holding onto the vision of who I wanted to become. Coding gave me a sense of direction I had never felt before, and each small achievement, each solved bug, each completed challenge, reinforced that I was on the right path.

What truly kept me going, though, was the community. Codédex made me feel supported, seen, and encouraged at every step. When you’re surrounded by people who genuinely believe in your potential, it becomes much easier to believe in yourself!

## What’s the best part of your new success?

The best part of my success is everything I’m doing right now in the space innovation world in Switzerland. Coding really opened doors I never imagined. Today, I’m involved in space hackathons, collaborating with organizations in the Swiss space ecosystem, and even getting opportunities to speak at events like NASA Space Apps Lucerne.

Being able to contribute to real space-related projects, meet researchers, innovators, and passionate people… that’s something my past self would have never believed possible. And it all started the day I decided to learn how to code.

_It was the \[first] day of the NASA Space Apps 2025 and I gave everyone motivational and (hopefully) inspiring words before getting started._

## If you could build one piece of fictional tech into reality, what would it be?

I would build a quantum-powered portable computer. 🤓

Something small enough to hold in your hand, but powerful enough to simulate gravitational fields, predict orbital trajectories, or run complex physics models in real time. It would be the ultimate tool for space innovation, research, and problem-solving!

## If you had a magic wand to change anything about Codédex, what would you do?

If I had a magic wand, I wouldn’t change Codédex, I’d amplify it. I’d make sure every lost, confused, or stuck person in the world somehow finds their way to this platform, the same way I did. You have no idea how many lives you’re silently changing.

Thank you for changing mine. 🙏🏻
