## And... that's a wrap!

Thank YOU all for being here. 🫶

We wouldn’t have such a fun and successful hackathon without all of you! You totally CRUSHED it! Whether you were finishing up final exam season or juggling your full-time job, give yourselves a pat on the back. Hacking is no easy feat, but you all made it look easy… and pretty! We had a blast (from the past) reviewing all of your projects. 🚀

One more shoutout to our special guests, [Audrey Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/audrey-chen-tech) (21x hackathon winner) and [Steve Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevechendc) (founder at Code & Coffee) for joining us and bringing this to life with us.

This was a huge milestone and we are beyond grateful to have you as part of our growing community. We also learned so much and aim to do it bigger and better next time~ ✨

Enjoy your holidays! ❄️
