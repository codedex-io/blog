## And... that's a wrap!

Thank YOU all for being here. 🫶

We didn't know what to expect since we _just_ launched our Lua & Phaser Game Dev courses on Codédex and y'all completely blew all expectations. What a talented and passionate community. We had a blast (from the past) reviewing all of your projects. 🚀

This was a huge milestone and we are beyond grateful to have you as part of our growing community. We also learned so much and aim to do it bigger and better next time~ ✨

Happy New Year! 🥳
