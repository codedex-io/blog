## And... that's a wrap!

Thank YOU all for being part of this. 🫶

We honestly didn’t know what to expect since we _just_ launched our Lua & Phaser game development courses on Codédex... and y'all completely blew us away. The talent, creativity, and passion in this community are unreal. Some of the greatest games in history started as small experiments and from game jams like this, and we can’t wait to see the epic worlds and ideas you bring to life next. 🚀

Happy New Year! 🥳
