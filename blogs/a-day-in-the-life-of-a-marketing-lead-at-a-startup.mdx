Hi, I’m Naomi! I do all things marketing here @ Codédex: make silly videos, spend way too much time deciding on video sound effects, and doomscroll on TikTok 24/7 (I like to call it market research). 😉

I make my job sound silly, but it’s actually \~quite\~ meaningful to me. I love sharing our story and journey with the world (quite literally, we’re in 192+ countries... woah!). 🫶🏻

## About Me

I was born in Hong Kong and grew up in New York City. I immigrated to the States with my family when I was four years old. Fun fact: I live in the same family home to this day. My dad vlogged a lot of my childhood (the OG content creator) and growing up, I was always drawn to creative hobbies: making friendship bracelets, doing crossword puzzles, and DDR aka [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution). In high school, I was obsessed with taking outfit pictures and modeling for freelance photographers (back when [urbex-ing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration) was a thing). 📸

All in all, Naomi knew who she was from a very young age. I then went on to study Marketing Management with a minor in Communications at CUNY [Baruch College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_College) and have fallen in love with the social media space since.

So… if you’re curious about who I am and what I do on a daily basis, here it is:

The (lowkey) viral IG post with 1,000+ likes that inspired this blog post. ⬆️

## How I ended up working for Codédex?

After I graduated in winter 2023, I was freelancing a bunch: social media management, content creation, and UGC deals. I stumbled upon Codédex’s [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codedex) job listing for a part-time Content Creator. I checked out the site, the socials, and saw Sonny’s [video here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1OB57lAzSe).

I made [this video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1-PImaOmwY) to apply, told my friends to go hype it up, & legit prayed. I really wanted the role; the team seemed like super great vibes, I wanted to work with a team IRL (versus working remote all the time), and I loved the aesthetic of the site. ✨

The conversation that started it all:

I posted this on my IG Story Close Friends right after (LOL):

And here I am, one year later. Very grateful and blessed.

## What's the best part of working as a Marketing Lead?

First of all, the creative freedom I have! Something I really enjoy about my job is that I have a lot of ownership in my role, meaning if I have an idea (whether that’s a TikTok, a social series concept like **#CodedexCribs**, or hosting a community event)... 90% of the time it comes to life! That’s the beauty of working in a startup, truly. 💓

Second, I love connecting with you all and building community. I’ve always enjoyed our IRL events; my favorites being the [Gen-Z Women in Tech](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5HIxZdgMyo) @ Verci and our [Back 2 School Bash](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBMxnzXStFy) @ Wix. It’s so heartwearming being able to bring passionate techies together. 🫶🏻

Lastly (I have to say it…), I love the people I work with. Everyone at Codédex is super bright, passionate, and driven. I’ve never been part of a team that ships *this* much on a weekly basis. Just check out [our changelogs](https://x.com/search?q=%23codedexchangelog&src=typed_query) on Twitter. Last year, I was dealing with matters that drastically affected my mental health and I received the best support and encouragement from the team. We’re also very silly and being in the office is truly a joy. 🥰

## Things I struggle with

Being stuck in 200 views jail. 

As a content creator, it’s *extremely* difficult to not tie my self-worth to the number of views, likes, etc. that my videos get. Sometimes, I’ll put a lot of effort into one video and it might just completely flop, which happens…  but why does that happen?!

Also, being stuck in a creative rut. Sometimes, my mind goes blank when I have to come up with a video idea to promote a new product feature/course.

## If you had a $50,000 budget for a marketing campaign, what would you do?

OMG. Music to my ears. 

I would buy flights for the whole team to Bali (where all the digital nomads are), rent a nice BNB for the month with a nice pool, lounge area, and extremely wide flat-screen TV. I’d make this a social series, of course. The first video would be called “I Convinced My NYC Team to Work in Bali?!” I’d vlog everyday: team moments, lunches, post-work beach time LOL. 

This would be a dream come true, for real. 🏝️

## A Day in the Life

### 7AM

I’m definitely a morning bird over a nite owl, so I’m usually up at 7-8AM (but also my daughter Haku wakes me up by stepping all over me) and I immediately hit the gym. I’m super into weightlifting; I’ve been at it for about four years now. I like to get a lift in and end with a stairmaster session. 🏋️

### 9AM

Since I live in the *depths* of Brooklyn – it takes me about 45 minutes and 3 trains to get to work. It’s all good, though; I love my morning train rides. I usually listen to a good SoundCloud playlist, look through my photos or edit a video, and people watch on the train. 🚇

### 9:30AM

I *always* go to [Devocíon](https://www.devocion.com/), our local coffee shop. My go-to order is an iced cappuccino with the Toro bean and oat milk, specifically the [toro bean](https://www.devocion.com/products/house-blend-coffee-toro). ☕️

### 10AM

The good ol’ daily standup. Or shall I call it… daily sit-down, because really… we’re sitting. We go over every team’s major updates (curriculum, engineering, product, and marketing), clear any blockers, and yap about our weekends. 🗣️

![slides](https://i.imgur.com/D5m9iYE.png)

### 11AM

LOCK-IN. Let’s get into the nitty gritty of this blog. I do some admin tasks: respond to DMs/comments, engage with your guys’ posts/mentions about us, and go through Slack messages/emails. ✉️

Then, I doomscroll. JK, but actually. I scroll through all socials: see what’s trending/relevant. As the marketing lead (but also, social media manager), I have to be up-to-date on industry trends! 

### 1PM

Lunch time, best time. I’m a huge foodie, so I’m really glad the rest of the team is too. Imagine *not* eating well with your team?! Good nite! Our favorites in the area are [Em Vietnamese](https://www.emrestaurants.com/), [Los Tacos Al Pastor](https://www.instagram.com/lostacosalpastor/), and [Fontainhas](https://www.fontainhasnyc.com/). 😋

### 2PM - 6PM

LOCK IN mode with my big AirPods Max. I like to edit during this time, specifically after lunch, since I know I won’t get interrupted by a lunch break. I really need deep focus when I edit since I have to rewatch the videos 10x over sometimes, make very important decisions on font and sound effects, and decide on which emojis to use. 😉

I also run our creator program and it’s truly so fun for me. Our creators have very different personalities and content styles, so it’s so awesome to see how Codédex’s story is told through different lenses. I’ve been strategizing on how to scale the program, track their videos and its progress, and have been planning a creator dinner for them.

### 6PM

I like to have my ‘lil yap & snack session with the team before I leave. We talk about our dreams for the new office, fundraise updates, and just… life?! 

### 7PM to 12AM

Most of the time, I’ll head home but sometimes I’ll grab dinner with a friend in the city. On this day, I had met up with my high school best friend, Maimuna at [TACOMBI](https://www.tacombi.com/) to try their newest menu item: ribeye steak taco. I must be honest; this was just OK, but the interior was really cute! I trek back to the depths of Brooklyn afterwards.

Good nite! Lites out. I go into a deep sleep and dream about our dream office. 💭

That’s a day in the life of doing marketing at a startup. It’s fast-paced, things are ever-changing everyday, and can get chaotic – just how I like it. I’m very people-oriented, so building, connecting, and engaging with you all and sharing our story to you all means a lot to me, and to us as a team.

Anyway, thanks for reading, for supporting us, and for being here. 

Feel free to give me a follow for more of… me!🧍‍♀️
