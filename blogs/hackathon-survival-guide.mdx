Hi, it's [Gabby](https://www.codedex.io/@gabtot) @ Codédex. With the school year starting, hackathons are starting to roll around as well!

Hackathons are some of my favorite events I go to throughout the year. I’ve been to about 20 hackathons, won 7, and even organized a couple! 

If you’ve never been to a hackathon but you’ve always wanted to, here’s a guide to help you get into the zone! It’s perfect for beginners, folks not familiar coding but want to get into the industry and learn how to make cool stuff, and people who are tired of computer science and math classes and want to do something more real-world applicable.

## Why go?

A **hackathon** is a free, usually weekend-long event where people team up to brainstorm, build, and showcase tech projects. It’s part competition, part collaboration, and a great way to learn new skills, meet peers, and experiment with ideas.

Few things to note:

- 🌱 Your experience level **doesn’t matter**. They welcome everyone from beginners to experts, and what you’re studying doesn’t tend to matter!
- 🆓 Almost everything is **free** because it’s covered by the hackathon organizers!
- 🚀 You can **build a project** to learn new things, or add to your resume.
- 👕 You can **collect swag** from the hackathon itself as well as cool companies.
- 🗺️ You can **meet people** from other schools and make friends all over the country.
- ✈️ You can travel to **different cities** and get reimbursed for your travel (potentially).
- 🏆 Win **cool prizes** like new devices!
- 👀 Maybe even **get a job** or meet someone that can help you get one!

## What to bring

- ☑️ A laptop, of course
- ☑️ Headphones (to lock in)
- ☑️ A friend (optional, we’ll get into that soon)
- ☑️ Toiletries
- ☑️ Pillow
- ☑️ Sleeping bag or air mattress + blanket

## Come with a friend... or find one!

I have designated friends who I usually frequent hackathons with. I met them through my classes and planning hackathons! You can definitely ask friends who are in your classes and friends who enjoy technology to come along with you. Having company definitely makes going to hackathons less daunting! 👯

On the flip side, I’ve gone to hackathons totally alone. Many other people do too, and you can team up with them to build a project, do fun activities, or explore the area together. I’ve met friends at hackathons, and we spent off time from the event drinking boba and doing escape rooms. Projects and distance aside, I still talk to a lot of these friends today.

## Winning prizes

Hackathons will typically have prompts that you can try to win prizes for. For example, if you win a prize for “best mobile app” you could win a speaker, but if you win a prize for “most environmentally friendly hack” you could win some headphones. You could try to make a project based on what you want to win the most, or just make something that you feel like making. Some companies also sponsor their own prizes with their own prompts on what needs to be built, and offer gift certificates or job interviews. Bigger events also offer bigger prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place that you could try for if you’re feeling extra competitive. 

## Take advantage of the food

Most hackathons come supplied with meals and snacks. You can find anything from pizza, pasta, Pad Thai, sandwiches, Buldak noodles (for a spicy noodle challenge 🥵), tikka masala, naan, boba, and warm cookies. Best of all, unless stated otherwise, it’s free. Make sure you’re not building on an empty stomach. It’s important to stay healthy and hydrated, no matter how much your code is calling to you to keep working!

## Connecting with companies

Some companies provide hackathon-exclusive job application links, or extend accepting job applications for specific event attendees. You can learn more about companies and their recruiting processes. At BigRed Hacks in Cornell, my friend and I were able to meet with a recruiter to get feedback on our project portfolios so we knew what to improve when submitting to jobs in the future. You never know who you may meet!

## Freebies

Most hackathon organizers design 2-3 key pieces of merch specifically for the event. Keep an eye out for event specific shirts, bags, or stickers. Some hackathons even have annual plushies! Companies also tend to provide their own swag that you can grab from their tables. One booth I went to was getting rid of 3 boxes of T-shirts, and I grabbed 12 and gave them to all my friends at home. You might be able to find stuff you need like water bottles or stationery!

## Events

Many hackers like to lock in on their projects but don’t realize that there are events to go to as well! You could learn a new piece of technology, how to build a mini project from the ground up, or hear from an industry speaker about their experiences.

Fun events I’ve been to and heard of include rock painting, petting zoos, a 360 spinning ride, puppy pits, spicy noodle challenges, juggling tutorials, lock picking workshops, claw machines, Microsoft Paint challenges, and karaoke in a lecture hall. It’s never a bad idea to step away from your screen and do something fun and whimsical for the sake of having a good time.

## Taking care of yourself

Some hackathons provide showers, but if they don’t, make sure you’re staying fresh and hygienic for the sake of you and everyone around you. If you’re able to, get some sleep! My first hackathon I got 1 hour of sleep and slept for 16 hours as soon as it was over. A couple of hours truly makes all the difference!

## Lastly: It’s about the ✨ Journey ✨

While I’ve won a handful of hackathons, I’ve also lost many. It can suck, especially when you’re gunning for specific prizes. But at the end of the day, what matters the most is what you get out of attending: building your coding muscles and strengthening relationships with your peers.
