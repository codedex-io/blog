Another month, another changelog!

From a full product revamp to wrapping up our Java course and reducing down costs, we've got a lot to talk about.

Let's get straight into it.

## 🏆 Monthly Challenge Revamp

Monthly Challenge was an idea we came up with back in 2022, to give our learners something fun to look forward to every month. At the time, this idea was beyond what the platform was cabable of. We started off by conducting the challenge via social post, then Discord, then in our old OPC. But all of these lacked a few key features.

How do I easily view old challenges? How do I know see the winners? Along with an overall UI/UX improvemtn, these were the few things this revamp sought to tackle.

Key updates:

- 🌐 [New landing page](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge)
- 📝 [New Submissions feed](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/aZwonmhOYu8BWfZLpGZK?tab=submissions)
- 🏆 [New Winners tab](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/aZwonmhOYu8BWfZLpGZK?tab=winners)
- 🧩 New Filtering system

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}

## 🤑 Cloud Usuage improvements

![Burning money gif](https://i.imgur.com/vI0koYT.jpeg)

At Codédex, we ship and we ship alot. Some weeks, we're releasing multiple features at once. While the team is proud of this, it sometimes means things aren’t as optimized as they could be.

That’s usually fine when the userbase is small, until it’s not. This year alone, our userbase has grown 5-6x, so it was time to take a step back and see where we're burning money and improvements can be made.

Key optimizations:

- 🔥 56% improvement on Firebase usuage.
  - We spent $5,686 on Firebase this month, compared to the $13,137 we would have spent without optimization.
- 🧪 Python exercise 1–2 updated to use regex-based checks
  - By replacing an LLM based check with a regex, we saved ~$900/month on just two exercises.

These two optimizations alone saved us $8,351 this month! Which is enough for a new team member or 2,087 Wendy's 4 for $4 🍔.

Shoutout to [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma) for making these improvements!
