We’ll keep this short since things have been going well.

Thanks to strong growth, we just had our **lowest net burn** in two years (since July 2023 🥲). We also signed a lease for a bigger office as we prep for the next few months. 

Making some moves.

## 🏆 Monthly Challenge Glow Up

That’s right! We gave our [Monthly Challenge](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge) page a makeover. Now it’s easier than ever to browse, filter, and get inspired by the current and past challenges.

Here's what's new:

## 💸 Cloud Usuage Improvements

![Burning money gif](https://i.imgur.com/vI0koYT.jpeg)

We pride ourselves on shipping fast – sometimes too fast. In the past 12 months, our userbase has grown 5x, so it was time to take a step back and take a hard look at where we are burning cash, especially on the IT & infrastructure side.

Key optimizations:

- Google Cloud: Improved Firebase usage by 56%. Saved ~$7,450/month.
- OpenAI: Replaced LLM-based checks with regex. Saved ~$900/month.

Total saved: \$8,350/month! Which is enough for a new hire or 2,087 Wendy's 4 for \$4. 🍔

Shoutout to [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma) for making these improvements!

## Final Thoughts

Get ready for our v1.0 launch in mid to late July!

It’s been exactly three years since I left Codecademy after the Skillsoft acquisition. I didn’t know what would come next – only that I needed to build something new and lasting in this space, with a team that is just as wild and ambitious as me.

Since starting Codédex, we've been so heads-down building that we haven't properly launched the product since our scrappy MVP debut on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex) in November 2022. I rewatched the video today – it's almost unrecognizable. We've grown up.

But now, the question is no longer _“Will we make it?”_ but _“What kind of company do we want to become?”_ and _“How can we be so impactful, so transformative, that we shift the trajectory of this planet for the better?”_

To get there, we're going back to the drawing board. 

Here's our plan: 1) craft our mission statement and story, 2) reintroduce Codédex to the world, and 3) launch the manifesto this fall as our answer to the times.

The future's v bright.

Sonny
