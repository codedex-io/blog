Apologies for the late update! It’s been another busy month.

Our numbers continue to climb. We’ve also officially signed an NDA with Microsoft/GitHub for a multi-partnership deal. 😮

Let's get straight into it!

## 🐣 30NitesOfCode Revamp

![A screenshot #30NitesOfCode feature](https://i.imgur.com/sXZdO7D.gif)

[Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline) came in with another hot one. We originally launched this feature in March 2024, and since then, over 42,000 users have adopted a pet, with the #30NitesOfCode hashtag generating more than 18,400 tweets! But it was due for a major redesign. Our goal? To clear up common confusions while making the habit-building experience more immersive, fun, and effective.

Here are the main updates:

- 🐣 [New landing page](https://www.codedex.io/30-nites-of-code) 
- 👯 [New community channel](https://www.codedex.io/community/30-nites-of-code)
- 👋 New onboarding flow
- ❤️ New heart meter system
- 🎬 New cute af cutscenes

You can read about into all the details in the [revamp blog](https://www.codedex.io/blog/30-nites-of-code-revamp-2025) by Jackie!

Taking a page from The Browser Company and our favorite creators, we’re leaning more into long-form videos. While we’ve cracked [short-form](https://www.instagram.com/codedex.io), long-form content lets us build a deeper connection with our community – taking them behind the scenes of our startup journey and giving them a chance to get to know the team better.

Join [Sonny](https://www.codedex.io/@sonny) in our first-ever product update video! In this video, he's sharing a behind-the-scenes look at everything that’s been happening at Codédex in January, Februray, and March – from new product features to course launches.

Our 24-hour image carousel showcasing a day in the life of four team members (Naomi, Asiqur, Lil, and myself) was a massive hit. So let’s give ’em more of this!

## IT Costs

![IT Costs](https://i.imgur.com/VpWuKav.png)

Our IT costs have climbed thanks to skyrocketing traffic... growth comes at a price.

Here are our top 6 bills in April, ranked:

- ☁️ **Google Cloud**: $19,137
- 🚀 **Vercel**: $7,463
- 📊 **Amplitude**: $3,429
- 🤖 **OpenAI**: $2,878
- 💌 **Mailchimp**: $1,976

Good problems to have. We’ve met with the teams at Vercel, Google Cloud, and Amplitude, and kicked off Firebase optimization to tighten expenses without sacrificing performance.

## Final Thoughts

Wow. Of the 14 categories on YC's [Request for Startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs) list, two focus on education: “AI Personal Tutor for Everyone” and “The Future of Education.” Who would’ve thought? Education is hot again, now that the final puzzle piece has fallen into place.

But after a decade in this space, here’s what YC (and most of the industry) overlooks:

The next big disruption in education won’t be a chatbot or an adaptive course; it’ll be a platform built in the intersection of **education** / **multiplayer** / **gamification**, with AI tutors and personalization layered on top.

That’s where the real magic happens. And that’s where we’re planting our flag.

One step at a time. We are SO close to profitability, and are focused on getting there by Codédex’s 3rd birthday. Let’s throw a party if we do. 🎈

P.S. Sharing a great recap from the iconic Jony Ive at Stripe Sessions 2025, reminding us to reintroduce joy and humor into the products we build:
