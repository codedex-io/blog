For the month of May, we'd like to try something different and fun! With the advent of artificial intelligence, we'd like to invite you to generate some coding-related art! 🖼️

Be as creative as you'd like, but make sure that what you generate is related to coding, programming, or tech.

Here are a few places you can go to generate some art for free:

✨ <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2" target="_blank">DALL·E 2 (OpenAI)</a>  
✨ <a href="https://stablediffusionweb.com/" target="_blank">Stable Diffusion</a>  
✨ <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F" target="_blank">Midjourney</a>  
✨ <a href="https://nightcafe.studio/" target="_blank">NightCafe</a>  

While the time may be variable, this challenge should take no more than one hour to complete. After finishing, post a screenshot in the <a href="https://twitter.com/codedex_io/status/1653793982600577025" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a>.

Please submit your image by Wednesday, May 24th so that our Discord community has ample time to vote on the winner!

**Note:** Only one image submission per user.
