## Introduction

Hi, I‚Äôm Ezra! üëã

I‚Äôm a 27 year old guy who lives in Brooklyn and has been working as a Product Manager for about 4 years. I currently work at [The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com), an independent, political tabloid. I‚Äôm responsible for developing new features to improve reader experience by coordinating between engineering, design, business, and editorial teams to bring them to launch. I love what I do!

## About me

I was born and raised in central Connecticut, then came to NYC almost 10 years ago to attend college at NYU. At that time, I was studying Music Business with the intention of working in the music industry. By the end of college, I had started working for a UGC video startup helping them license & categorize their music library. While there, I became really interested in the development process and pivoted into product management.

That startup ended up getting acquired by [VSCO](https://www.vsco.co) and I was unfortunately laid-off in the process. While I was looking for my next product role, I managed a couple of the GrowNYC farmer‚Äôs market locations in Brooklyn.. About a year after that, I landed my job at the Daily Beast where I've been for a little over 3 years.

## What's the best part of working as a PM?

For me, the best part of working as a PM is that every day is different and there is always something new to learn. Depending on which part of the product lifecycle I‚Äôm in, I could be working on vastly different types of tasks, which keeps the job interesting. Each time I take on a new project, there is so much to learn from understanding different user problems and figuring out potential technical solutions. Learning is cool! üòé

## A Day in the Life

My role is hybrid, so my days change a bit depending on whether I‚Äôm in the office or working from home. I‚Äôll lay them both out!

### 8:30 AM

My working hours are from 10AM - 6PM, so I tend to get up around 8:30 to give myself some extra time in the morning. 

**WFH days:** I use this time to hit the gym and knock out my workout first thing. This is actually a recent change from my previous evening routine and I‚Äôm finding it to be much more relaxing to go when the gym is less crowded and I‚Äôm less worn out from the day.

**Office days:** I get up, get ready, and head to the office. I commute from Brooklyn to our office in Chelsea, which takes about 45 minutes. I like to listen to Lenny‚Äôs Product Podcast during this time. He interviews successful people in various product roles from a variety of different companies. The convos are always really interesting (whether you‚Äôre in product or not) and I find it to be a good way to get into the work headspace. I highly recommend this!

### 10AM to 1PM

For the first half of the day, I‚Äôm typically focused on comms between teams. When I first sign on, I check through my unread messages and check on our topline metrics to get a sense of the day‚Äôs needs. Maybe there‚Äôs an engineer that needs clarification on a spec I wrote, maybe there‚Äôs been a dip in traffic following a recent release, or maybe someone from leadership is asking for a status update on the launch timeline for a new feature. I take inventory of all these things to plan out my day.

At 10:30 I join our daily standup with the engineering team to get an understanding of what all of the engineers are working on. This is where I can flag high priority tickets or bug reports.  It's also where I can help unblock the engineering team, if say, they‚Äôre waiting on feedback from another team (this often comes up with ads related work, which is QA‚Äôd by our ad operations team).

After standup, I follow up on my morning messages and anything that came up during standup. I think of this as my "unblocking time‚Äù where I try to clear up any confusion between teams and make sure everyone has what they need for the day.

### Lunch

**WFH days:** Not too interesting. I usually just make something simple like a sandwich or a smoothie. 

**Office days:** Our office is right by Chelsea Market AND Market 57 ‚Äì two food halls with a bunch of options. This is probably my favorite part of going in. 

My go-to spots are Very Fresh Noodles or Los Tacos No. 1. The lines can be long sometimes but it‚Äôs worth it. 10/10.

### 2PM to 4PM

This tends to be the window where a lot of my meetings are scheduled. These could be check-ins with stakeholder teams to provide updates on their tickets, or prioritization / planning meetings for upcoming work, or sometimes check-ins with vendors like our CMS or commenting service providers.

### 4PM to 6PM

The late afternoon is typically my heads down time to work on a variety of different things. Because the role of the PM is to manage the development of new features through Ideation, Development, Release, and Iteration, the tasks I work on vary widely depending on where I am in that cycle. 

This is a rough idea of what that might look like:
- Ideation: analyzing data & looking through customer support tickets to identify different areas of opportunity, OR conducting competitive research to identify new trends in the market  
- Development: drawing up a product spec or prototype to review with the engineering team, OR QAing work that has been completed / providing feedback to engineers 
- Release: reviewing the project KPI‚Äôs & site health pretty closely, as well as providing updates to the wider team
- Iteration: looking at analytics & user-segments to identify areas of improvement. This is mostly done in Google Analytics, but we also use Tableau and Parse.ly

### 6PM

**WFH days:** This is when I take out my dog, Cosmo. I live across from Prospect Park, so I love to take him for a long walk there. It‚Äôs a great way to wind down from the work day.

**Office days:** I‚Äôm either commuting home or meeting up with a friend in the city. For commuting, I‚Äôve recently gotten into this history podcast called The Fall of Civilizations that talks about the rise & fall of the biggest empires. I know, I know‚Ä¶ I sound like an annoying podcast guy now, but it is a good hands-free activity when on a rush hour subway car with no room to hold a book. 

### 8PM to Midnight

This is when I‚Äôll have dinner and either watch a movie with my girlfriend or play my Nintendo switch (shoutout to No Man‚Äôs Sky ‚Äì a cool space exploration game I started last week). I also take out Cosmo for one more short walk before bed.

That‚Äôs all folks!
