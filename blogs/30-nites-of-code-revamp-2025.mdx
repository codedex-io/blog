Hey everyone, it’s [Jackie](https://www.codedex.io/@jackieisonline)! We just launched some pretty *major* updates to #30NitesOfCode.

## What is #30NitesOfCode?

**#30NitesOfCode** is our habit-building feature where you commit to 30 days of learning and building, combining challenges like #100DaysOfCode with raising a virtual pet (e.g. Tamagotchi)! As you code every month, you get to log your progress to see your pet grow and evolve—while also hitting your learning goals through the power of small, consistent steps.

## The old #30NitesOfCode

We originally launched this feature in March 2024 ([see our blog about it here](https://www.codedex.io/blog/30-nites-of-code)) but it was due for a major redesign. Primarily, to address common areas of confusion and to make it even more immersive, fun, and engaging!

This means there are some big changes… but if you have an active pet, don’t worry—your progress is still there! Just make sure to review these updates to keep your challenge going.

## What's new in #30NitesOfCode?

### New #30NitesOfCode landing page 🎉

![The new landing page](https://i.imgur.com/Kst8rik.gif)

We gave #30NitesOfCode a new home with a redesigned [landing page](https://www.codedex.io/30-nites-of-code)! that shows how to get started, includes an FAQ, and directs you to begin raising a pet.

[Check it out here](https://www.codedex.io/30-nites-of-code)

### Starting the challenge 🥚

To start the challenge and begin raising a pet, click on the “I’m ready!” button on the #30NitesOfCode landing page. You’ll be able to choose an egg and name your pet to officially commit to the challenge. Then, add your first day of progress, or come back to add it later.

### Log your progress directly within #30NitesOfCode 🗓️

To log your daily process, go to your user dashboard and click the “Add progress” button on your #30NitesOfCode pet. You’ll be directed to a form on your pet’s page where you can choose a built-in tag that best describe your coding-related progress for the day, write a bit about what you worked on, and then post your progress!

After posting, you can then feed your pet (optional for the challenge, but highly recommended 💕) and see a log of your process below.

Before, adding daily progress required you to make a post on Twitter/X or the on-platform community (OPC), *then* submit a link to that post in the #30NitesOfCode page. Our new design simplifies this process to make it easier to submit progress every day.

### Tracking pet happiness

You can track your pet’s happiness using the heart meter. Make sure to not go below 1 heart!

| Hearts    | Status | Condition |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ❤️❤️❤️  &nbsp;&nbsp;| Great 😊 | You added progress today AND fed your pet afterwards! |
| ❤️❤️🤍  | Okay 👌 | You have yet to add progress for today, OR you’ve just added progress and have yet to feed your pet. |
| ❤️🤍🤍 | In danger ⚠️ | You missed progress for 1 or 2 days. If you miss another day of progress. |
| 🤍🤍🤍 | RIP 🪦  | You missed progress for 3 or more days, and your pet is gone :(  |


### What if I have existing progress?

If you currently have an ongoing #30NitesOfCode challenge, don’t worry! Your progress and pet is still there with this new design, and you can view any of your old Twitter or OPC posts within your progress log. However, any new progress needs to be logged using the new “Add progress” on your pet page. But after you post, you’re still welcome to share your progress to Twitter/X or LinkedIn!

### Updated cutscenes 🎬

We know you love our cutscenes: our immersive storytelling moments with music, sound effects, and animation… so we brought more to #30NitesOfCode! Now you can unlock 4 cutscenes (designed and prototyped by yours truly with CSS animations 👀) across the pet evolution experience. If you're feeling nostalgic, you can watch them again later anytime from your daily progress log.

### Missed progress reminders 🚨

Miss a day or two of progress? We’ll email you if you missed logging progress the day before. Plus, we'll give you a popup reminder the next time you’re on Codédex.

### Restarting and deleting 🔄

Need to restart with a new pet? We added a settings button that makes it easy to create a new pet without having to deliberately fail your current challenge—while still being able to view your past progress.

Plus, we offer an option to permanently delete a pet's data and any progress logged with it.

### Start the #30NitesOfCode challenge today!

Whether you’re a first-time pet parent or a seasoned champion of the challenge, we’re excited to share the new #30NitesOfCode with you. Make sure to let us know what you think!

Happy coding,
Jackie
