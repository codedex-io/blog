Last week, we hosted our first ever 24-hour [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)! What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition? 🚀

**176 hackers** from **25 countries** showed up and **37 teams** made it across the finish line ([all projects](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023))! Altogether, it was a HUGE blast. 

We had two hackathon tracks: 1) "In the Holiday Spirit" and 2) "New Year, New Me".

Now, it's time to announce the results... 🥁...


#### 🎄 Best "In the Holiday Spirit" Hack

Congrats on winning the "In the Holiday Spirit" category, Team Bumi from Boston! The judges and the team LOVED this project. So fun and interactive (drag and drop + holiday music) and the isometric room inspired by the Codédex landing page. Great documentation (images/video), too!

From the bottom of my heart and the whole Codédex Team, **THANK YOU** to all 176 hackers and the two judges [Josh Goldberg](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg) and [Wyatt Ades](https://twitter.com/wyattades) that joined us for our first-ever virtual hackathon.
