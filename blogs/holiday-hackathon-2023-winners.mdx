Last week, we hosted our first ever 24-hour [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)! What better way to wrap up the year than get together for some fun and friendly competition? üöÄ

**176 hackers** from **25 countries** showed up and **37 teams** made it across the [finish line](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge/december-2023)! Altogether, it was a HUGE blast. 

We had two hackathon tracks: 1) "In the Holiday Spirit" and 2) "New Year, New Me".

Now, it's time to announce the results... ü•Å...
