Long time no Boba Talk! 🧋

Ep. # 12 with Victoria Kirst, better known online as vrk, (former VP of Eng at Glitch, Tech Lead at Google, Software Engineer at The Browser Company) just went live. 🎙️

Victoria chats all about her coding journey: from playing with MS Paint and building anime fan sites to spending 7+ years at Google (twice!) working on Google Maps and Google Chrome to now, pursuing her love of paper through Pouch, her indie magazine.

A must-listen for any code newbies and creative technologists. 💌

## Transcript

Once you’ve got an idea, you figure out which programming languages you need and which tools might be helpful for you. Google stuff, ask for guidance in the Codédex Discord or the on-platform [community](https://www.codedex.io/community), or simply use [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com).

For example, if I want to build cute little websites and desktop apps, I need the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, plus Figma to design layouts, Photoshop or Canva to make illustrations, and yess… a good pencil and paper to sketch out my ideas. 😍

So, the tools you need really depend on your project and your process. 

## Links

Now, you’ve got 12 cool coding project ideas right in front of you. ✨

Pick the project that sounds the most fun and interesting and just start building!

From now on, forget stressing over which programming language to start with. Instead, ask yourself:

- What do I wish existed?
- What do I like outside of coding? Reading? Music? Games?
- What do I _really_ want to create? Not for a job application, but for myself.
- What can I build for my friends & family, my local community, or even the world?

Write down all your ideas, think about how you’d design them and which programming languages you’d use. Take notes, draw little sketches, and make that crazy, cool idea happen! 😍

Happy coding 💖, 
Sophie Gabe
