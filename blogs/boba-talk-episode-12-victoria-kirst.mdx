Long time no Boba Talk! Ep. #12 with Victoria Kirst just went live. 🎙️

Victoria Kirst, better known online as vrk, is a tech veteran (former VP of Engineering at [Glitch](https://glitch.com), Tech Lead @ [Google](https://google.com), Software Engineer @ [The Browser Company](https://www.thebrowser.company) based in Brooklyn, NY. She's currently on a 2-year sabbatical exploring her love of paper through _Pouch_, her indie magazine, and her email newsletter. 

In this episode, I sat down with Victoria to talk about her coding journey, from playing with MS Paint and building anime fansites to spending 7+ years at Google (twice!) working on Google Chrome, Google Maps, VR, transitioning to a people manager at Glitch, and joining one of the hottest startups in the recent years, The Browser Company, before leaving to pursue the medium of paper through the lens of cute handdrawn zines.

A must-listen for any code newbies and creative technologists. 💌
