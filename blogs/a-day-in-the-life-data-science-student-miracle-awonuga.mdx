_Our "A Day in the Life" series is an inside view into what itâ€™s like working in tech for Gen Zs. From college interns getting their first peek into tech to recent professionals whoâ€™ve been on the scene, weâ€™ll share their experience, inspiration, tips & tricks, and more!_

_In the third issue, we are featuring Miracle Awonuga (she/her), a recent graduate of Belmont University's data science program (first black woman to do so), organizer at WaffleHacks, intern at LinkedIn, and project author at CodÃ©dex. Enjoy!_

##### Hiii Miracle! Tell us a bit about yourself.

Hello everyone! My name is Miracle Awonuga. I was born and raised in Antioch, TN, a city 30 minutes southeast of Nashville. I am a proud first generation Nigerian-American. I recently graduated from [Belmont University](https://belmont.edu) in Nashville with a data science degree. I am the first Black woman to achieve this in the universityâ€™s history. 

I am also the former co-Director of People and Communications at [WaffleHacks](https://wafflehacks.org), where I fostered relationships with our sponsors, partners, and community members. 

In my free time, I like to play piano, do nail art, and watch video essays!

##### What are you currently up to? 

I am getting ready to start grad school! I will be working towards my Masters in Data Science at [Middle Tennessee State University](https://www.mtsu.edu) located in Murfreesboro, TN. 

##### How did you get into the field?

Fun fact: I started college as a computer science major! I realized the spring of my freshman year that CS was not for me while struggling through an exam for my Programming I class. I felt like computer science limited my ability to pursue all of my passions and be creative. I heard a voice whisper inside of me begging me to consider switching to data science. 

After doing research and checking out what Belmont had to offer with the field, I knew I had to switch my major. Making the switch to data science is one of the top 5 best decisions Iâ€™ve made because I have more resources and skills to pursue my passions in ways I never thought were possible.

##### Wow ok... so why data science at Belmont?

This is one of my favorite questions in the world. 

I chose to study data science at Belmont because of how personalized the program can be. During my undergrad, I focused on the intersectionality of tech, education policy, and digital media, and I was able to successfully incorporate all of those areas in my course of study. The program is always finding ways to collaborate with other departments at the university and the community, so there are ample opportunities to apply the skills you learn inside the classroom. 

Additionally, I love the non-competitive nature of STEM in general at Belmont. Everyone there wants you to succeed, and they will do whatever it takes to achieve your goals. Having such a strong foundation during undergrad has made me excited about my grad school journey at MTSU because I donâ€™t have to worry about trying to figure out what I want to do. Instead, I get to focus on expanding my expertise.

##### What does a typical work day look like?

During my last semester of undergrad, my days were pretty busy. However, I always started it with a slow morning. This would include listening to NPRâ€™s [Morning Edition](https://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition), eating breakfast, and taking my time to get ready for the day. 

After that, I would have class from 11am - 3:30pm. Some of my favorite classes from this time include Computing for Scientific Research, Data Science Project/Portfolio, [Belmont University x Fisk University Social Justice Collaborative](https://news.belmont.edu/belmont-and-fisk-universities-announce-social-justice-collaborative) class, and Podcasting. After classes ended for the day, I would go back to my campus apartment, eat lunch, and work on my senior project. I would either work on improving my predictive models, coding through interviews I had with experts, or working on my presentation/paper. 

In the evenings, I can be found either attending leadership meetings for the different student organizations I was part of or spending time with my friends or roommates. Finally, I end my day with a call with my mom.

##### Data Science framework you can't live without?

[Plotly](https://plotly.com) is my pride and joy. It is my favorite tool for data visualization. Plotly makes it simple to understand your data, which makes finding insights a quick and easy process.

I wrote a [Analyze YouTube Data with Plotly Express](https://www.codedex.io/projects/visualize-youtube-data-with-plotly) project that you can check out.

##### Do you have any tips for younger students?

[LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning) has been my go-to in helping me freshen up my data science skills! There are so many courses that cater to your needs and meet you at your skill level. If you are in the US, check to see if your local library gives patrons free access to their library.

And CodÃ©dex of course! ðŸ˜Š

##### Whatâ€™s a personal project that you're proud of?

A personal project I am really proud of is my senior project, [Oh, To Be a Scholar!](https://github.com/mawonuga121/ohtobeascholar) 

This was my senior project at Belmont. I created an interactive data science research exhibit that explored whether or not the type of school you attend affects your ability to be a college bound scholar. This one is my absolute favorite because I was able to bring together my life experiences, Belmont education, and undergraduate research into one big project. I was so satisfied with how it turned out. 

An accomplishment I am really proud of is being the first Black woman to graduate from Belmontâ€™s data science program. Representation matters so much to me, so being able to show all the Black and brown women who will eventually come through this program that they can do it is so meaningful to me.

##### What's your dream job?

My dream job is doing research or consulting in education policy! 

My research during undergrad focused on education policy, specifically urban education and higher ed.  There is a huge need for data scientists in this field, especially for making policy decisions for students of color and teachers.

##### Who or what inspired you to get into data?

The person who inspired me to take data science seriously is the one and only Dr. Christina Davis, the Director of Data Science over at Belmont! 

She is one of my favorite people in the world. Dr. Davis pushed me to dream big about the application of my data science skills. Meeting another female data scientist really helped me believe that I have a place in the field.

##### Favorite emoji or emoji combo?

My current favorite emoji combo is... ðŸª©ðŸŒˆâœ¨

I am currently on a mission to make my life as vibrant as possible because I know I am worthy of love and happiness every day!

##### What's been your biggest challenge?

My biggest challenge in getting to where I am today is the lack of representation. 

As of now, there are only [4.2% Black professionals](https://www.zippia.com/data-scientist-jobs/demographics) in the field. It is hard navigating through a field where I do not see people who look like me/share similar experiences as me because it makes me question the validity of my projects since my work primarily focuses on historically excluded communities. It also makes me question if I should even be in data science. Why would I be in an industry that no one like me is barely in? 

However, I am grateful to have the opportunity to pave the way for the next generation of Black data scientists through my contributions to the field so far.

##### Any last thoughts? :)

The world needs your work! It needs your ideas and your passions! Always remember that there are people willing to make space for you and support you throughout your journey x
