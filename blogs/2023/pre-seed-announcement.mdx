Codédex, a brand new learn to code platform for Gen Z, is thrilled to announce that we’ve raised $750k in a pre-seed round led by NP-Hard Ventures, Worklife Ventures, NY Ventures, Hustle Fund, Transcend Network, Goodwater Capital, Z Fellows & angels.

We’re a small but mighty team based in Brooklyn, NY, building a one-stop shop for the next generation of builders and dreamers. 

Since launching on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex#codedex) a year ago, we now have:

- 💖 5 full-time team members supporting...
- 👯 100k registered users from...
- 🌎 192 countries around the world

...and we’re just getting started.

In the months to come, we’ll be supporting more teachers in K-12 schools, expanding our content catalog, and doubling down on the on-platform community.

Thanks for joining us on this ride, and special thanks to our community for believing in the mission to make learning to code fun and collaborative!

Back to building. See you in the [OPC](https://www.codedex.io/community).
