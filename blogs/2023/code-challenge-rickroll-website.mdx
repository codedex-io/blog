Every year, many parts of the world celebrate [April Fools' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools'_Day) on April 1st. But here at Codédex, we'd like to celebrate it all month long! 🥳

For the **Monthly Code Challenge** in April, we'd like you to build a simple and fun website that pranks your friends by "Rickrolling" them!

## What is Rickrolling?

A [Rickroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) is an online prank featuring a link to Rick Astley's one-hit wonder "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video disguised as something else. 

It's a classic internet meme that's been around forever; It grew popular on [4chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) in 2007. And the music video now has over 1 billion views on YouTube!

## Fun Ideas

Here are a few ideas for what the site could feature:

- A website that says something like "Your library books are due! Click here to renew!" and link "here" to the Rickroll video.
- A QR code that says it points to the menu of a new restaurant.
- A WhatsApp bot that baits your friends.

## Submission

Feel free to be as creative as you like to pull off the prank and post a screenshot of your website in the [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/codedex_io/status/1645496363055030293) or in the **#monthly-challenge** channel in Discord. Bonus points if you share your friends’ reactions like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). 🕺

**Submission Deadline:** Friday, April 28th for a chance to win a special surprise! ⏰

Happy coding,  
Brandon
