What better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than by sharing a poem with your friends and family? In this challenge, you will create a poem on a web page using HTML.

**Requirements:**

- Use a combination of at least five common HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and text formatting.
- The poem can take on any form you like! You can freestyle with as many lines as your heart desires, but here are some suggestions for common poem types:
  - Sonnet (14 lines)
  - Haiku (3 lines; 5 syllables, 3 syllables, 5 syllables, respectively)
  - Limerick (5 lines; rhyme scheme AABAB)

**Bonus:** 

Make your Valentine's Day poem as pretty or complex in style (background color, border, etc.) by doing one of the following:

- Use a `<style>` element in the `<head>` of the document.
- Apply a global style attribute to various elements in the `<body>` of the document.

Try [our course](https://www.codedex.io/html) if you need a quick refresher on HTML!

Submit a screenshot of your web page by Feb 14th for a chance to win a special surprise! If you want, you can tag the person the valentine is for so they can see it.

May the best poet win. ðŸ’•
