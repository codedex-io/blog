#### Why are we touring?

Getting to know our users and be part of students' journeys early and often is important to us! We want to meet you all to know and share insights on the job climate today.

We want to give back to the community and plant a flag in our hometown (NYC)! In the finale event, we hope to bring together the CS students from Columbia, NYU, and CUNY.
