#### Why are we touring?

Getting to know our users and be part of students' journeys early and often is very important to us! We want to meet you all and share insights on the job climate today. 👯

We also want to give back to the community and plant a flag in our hometown! At the final stop, we hope to bring together CS students + recent grads from the New York tri-state area.
