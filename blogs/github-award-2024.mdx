Look mom, we just won a GitHub Award!!! 🏆

From the **GitHub Student Developer Pack** partnership in 2024 to winning this award at [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) conference held in SF, this was truly a special moment for our little team. 

Thank you GitHub for this recognition! 🌟

#### 📜 The Award

Here’s what GitHub had to say about us:

> (Cue the Super Mario Bros PowerUp sound effect!) 

> At only two-years-old, Codédex is already used in over 800 high schools and colleges in the United States, Canada, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Germany, and India. GitHub first partnered with Codédex in Spring 2024. Since then, they’ve held monthly challenges, hosted hackathons, and built engaging features enjoyed by an active user base of over 200,000 people. They also hit the road for a Campus Tour, which included workshops, swag, and support to some of the biggest coding clubs at colleges across the North American east coast. Codédex hits the spot of community and collaboration for a generation of hungry young coders.

> _The Phenomenal Education Partner Award recognizes GitHub Education partners that provide strong support and opportunities for students, teachers, and schools._

**Note:** Our community has actually grown to 400,000 registered users now. :)

#### 🙏 Thank You

A huge thank you to the GitHub Education team, especially Morgan Ersery, Juan Pa, and PJ Metz, for nominating us and being such supporters. Looking forward to the next collab! 🤫

And, of course, mad props to the Codédex team – our blood, sweat, and tears are starting to pay off. This is a big validation from the dev community and we don't take it for granted.

P.S. Codédex's first trophy. 🥹
