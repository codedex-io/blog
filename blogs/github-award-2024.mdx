Look mom, we just won a Github Award!!! 🏆

From the GitHub Student Developer Pack partnership in 2024 to winning this award at GitHub Universe conference held in SF, this was truly a special moment for our little team. 

Thank you GitHub for this recognition! 🌟

#### ✅ The Award

We were invited to the GitHub Unverse 2024 held in SF.

Node.js isn’t a library – it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, like a food truck that lets a chef cook anywhere instead of just in a kitchen! Highest requested course. (This is also our first Club course.)
