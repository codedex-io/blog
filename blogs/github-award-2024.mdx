From the GitHub Student Developer Pack partnership in 2024 to winning this award at GitHub Universe conference held in SF, this was truly a special moment for our little team. 

Thank you GitHub for this recognition! 🌟

#### ✅ Code Evaluation (Beta)

We were invited to the GitHub Unverse 2024 held in SF.

#### Unboxing Video

Node.js isn’t a library – it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, like a food truck that lets a chef cook anywhere instead of just in a kitchen! Highest requested course. (This is also our first Club course.)

#### 🖼 Project Showcase

We redesigned our Project Showcase to feel more like a showcase (switched to a gallery-style presentation that emphasized each project’s cover image while making it clear how to filter by project tags). Added Staff Picks, too. Go and check out some projects!

#### 🏆 Leaderboards: Weekly vs. All Time

Leaderboards is an entirely new addition to our on-platform community! Now, you can see who has earned the most XP (gained by completing exercises and code challenges) to create more friendly competition. It's inspired by game leaderboards (i.e. Dota 2, League).

#### 🌐 Builds Sharing

![Builds](https://i.imgur.com/57dpRyU.png)

You can now share the HTML/CSS/JS projects that you built on Codédex with friends & family all with one click. Click [Share] and it generates a URL. Currently, the output has a Codédex watermark, but Clubbers will have the option to remove it in the future.

#### 🤓 Community Redesign

![Community Redesign blog](https://i.imgur.com/OFseIMe.png)

We redesigned our On-Platform Community aka the OPC! Take a look into our product process, design decisions, and what’s to come. This is the first blog post by Jackie, our product design and UI/UX mastermind behind all the recent revamp.
