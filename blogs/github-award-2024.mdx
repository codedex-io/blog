Look mom, we just won a Github Award!!! 🏆

From the GitHub Student Developer Pack partnership in 2024 to winning this award at GitHub Universe conference held in SF, this was truly a special moment for our little team. 

Thank you GitHub for this recognition! 🌟

#### ✅ Code Evaluation (Beta)

We were invited to the GitHub Unverse 2024 held in SF.

#### Unboxing Video

Node.js isn’t a library – it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, like a food truck that lets a chef cook anywhere instead of just in a kitchen! Highest requested course. (This is also our first Club course.)

#### 🏆 Leaderboards: Weekly vs. All Time

Leaderboards is an entirely new addition to our on-platform community! Now, you can see who has earned the most XP (gained by completing exercises and code challenges) to create more friendly competition. It's inspired by game leaderboards (i.e. Dota 2, League).

#### 🌐 Builds Sharing

You can now share the HTML/CSS/JS projects that you built on Codédex with friends & family all with one click. Click [Share] and it generates a URL. Currently, the output has a Codédex watermark, but Clubbers will have the option to remove it in the future.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginBottom: "1.2rem", transform: "scale(.9)" }}>
  <a href="https://www.codedex.io/builds" style={{ all: "unset" }} target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"><Button variant="yellow">View Buids</Button></a>
</div>

#### 🤓 Thank Yous

Big thank you to the GitHub Edu team, specically Morgan, Juan Pa, . 

#### Final Thoughts

Huge kudos to the Codédex team for this win. 🫰 

We have another GitHub partnership coming up. Shhh.
