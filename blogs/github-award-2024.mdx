Look mom, we just won a freaking GitHub Award!! 🏆

From the GitHub Student Developer Pack partnership in 2024 to winning this award at [GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com) conference held in SF, this was truly a special moment for our little team. 

Thank you GitHub for this recognition! 🌟

#### 📜 The Award

Here's what GitHub said about us... 🥹

> Codédex is a brand new way to learn to code online. The platform provides a way for learners to earn experience points (XP) as they journey through the fantasy land of Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Command Line, and Git & GitHub, unlock new regions, and collect badges at their own pace. (Cue the Super Mario Bros PowerUp sound effect!) At only two-years-old, Codédex is already used in over 800 high schools and colleges in the United States, Canada, Japan, Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and India. GitHub first partnered with Codédex in Spring of 2024. Since then, they’ve held monthly challenges, hosted hackathons, and built engaging projects that have been enjoyed by an active user base of over 200,000 people. They also hit the road for a 2024 Fall Campus Tour, which included workshops, swag, and support to some of the biggest coding clubs at colleges across the North American east coast. Codédex hits the spot of community and collaboration for a generation of hungry young coders.

> _The Phenomenal Education Partner Award recognizes GitHub Education partners that provide strong support and opportunities for students, teachers, and schools._

**Note:** We actually have 400,000 registered users now. :)
