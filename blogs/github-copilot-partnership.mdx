We have a brand new course on Codédex! 🔥

We’re thrilled to announce our new partnership with GitHub + Microsoft! ✈️

Launching September 15, 2025. Mark your calendars.

## Why Vibe Coding?

AI isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so why not use it to **code faster, smarter, and with less stress**? Vibe coding is another term for AI assisted coding. You focus on the vibe, and AI focuses on the coding. Turn vibe coding from a concept to a workflow using GitHub Copilot.

Let's get into it.

## GitHub Copilot Course

Our new course walks you through everything you need to know to start vibe coding with GitHub Copilot. It’s only two chapters, takes less than two hours, and is completely free.

Here’s what you’ll learn:

- ✈️ How to set up and configure GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- 📝 Techniques to prompt Copilot for clean, efficient code.
- 🚀 How to to build **two GUI applications from scratch** using AI assistance.

The course header was brought to life by **Saul**, a pixel artist based in Mexico, and the four chapter GIFs were animated by **Azuna** from Spain. 👾

### Rare Chapter Badges
