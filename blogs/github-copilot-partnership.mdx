We’re thrilled to announce our new partnership with GitHub + Microsoft! Woohoo! ✈️

## Why Vibe Coding?

AI isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so why not use it to **code faster, smarter, and with less stress**? Vibe coding is another term for AI assisted coding. You focus on the vibe, and AI focuses on the coding. Turn vibe coding from a concept to a workflow using GitHub Copilot.

And we’re here to help you get started.

## GitHub Copilot Course

Our new course walks you through everything you need to know to start vibe coding with GitHub Copilot. It's only two chapters and takes less than two hours. The best part? It's completely FREE!

Here’s what you’ll learn:

- ✈️ How to set up and configure GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- 📝 Techniques to prompt Copilot for clean, efficient code.
- 🚀 How to to build **two GUI applications from scratch** using AI assistance.

The course header was brought to life by **Saul**, a pixel artist based in Mexico 🇲🇽, and the four chapter GIFs were animated by **Azuna** from Spain. 🇪🇸

### Rare Chapter Badges
