We have a brand new course on Cod√©dex! üî•

Our first ever vibe coding course in partnership with GitHub + Microsoft. ‚úàÔ∏è

9.15.2025. Mark your calendars.

AI isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon, so why not use it to help code faster? Vibe coding is another term for AI assisted coding. You focus on the vibe, and AI focuses on the coding. Turn vibe coding from a concept to a workflow using GitHub Copilot.

Let's get into it.

## New Course

- üìù Techniques to prompt Copilot for clean, efficient code.
- üöÄ Build two GUI applications from scratch using AI assistance.
