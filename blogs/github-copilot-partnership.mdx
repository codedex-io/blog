We‚Äôre thrilled to announce our new partnership with GitHub + Microsoft! ‚úàÔ∏è

Launching September 15, 2025. Mark your calendars.

## Why Vibe Coding?

AI isn‚Äôt going anywhere anytime soon, so why not use it to **code faster, smarter, and with less stress**? Vibe coding is another term for AI assisted coding. You focus on the vibe, and AI focuses on the coding. Turn vibe coding from a concept to a workflow using GitHub Copilot.

Let's get into it.

## GitHub Copilot Course

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll learn:

- ‚úàÔ∏è How to set up and configure GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- üìù Techniques to prompt Copilot for clean, efficient code.
- üöÄ How to to build **two GUI applications from scratch** using AI assistance.

The course header was brought to life by **Saul**, a pixel artist based in Mexico, and the four chapter GIFs were animated by **Azuna** from Spain. üëæ
