We have a brand new course on Codédex! 🔥

Our first ever vibe coding course in partnership with GitHub + Microsoft. ✈️

9.15.2025. Mark your calendars.

AI isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so why not use it to help code faster? Vibe coding is another term for AI assisted coding. You focus on the vibe, and AI focuses on the coding. Turn vibe coding from a concept to a workflow using GitHub Copilot.

In this course, you will learn:

- ✈️ How to set up and configure GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
- 📝 Techniques to prompt Copilot for clean, efficient code.
- 🚀 Build two GUI applications from scratch using AI assistance.
