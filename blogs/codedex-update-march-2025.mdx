We did it — We clawed our way out of the tranches and are officially [Default Alive](https://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html). 🥲

Last month, we hit another inflection point, and growth is off the charts. **670K unique visitors** came to our website in March and expect the growth the continue.

The engine’s on and we’re off to the races.

#### 🌟 Product-Market Fit

Product-Market Fit is often described as an elusive milestone that’s difficult to quantify, but when it happens, it’s unmistakable. This past month, we’ve experienced it firsthand.

Our growth metrics show hockey-stick curves across all the right charts. What once felt like pushing a boulder uphill now feels like being pulled by momentum. We’re no longer second-guessing ourselves.

Learners started coming to us instead of the other way around. Y'all use Codédex, love it, and tell your friends about it (pls keep doing so!). The feedback shifted to urgent demands for more content/features and faster updates. The market is responding loudly and enthusiastically, and we’re ready to meet the demand head-on.

#### 🔢 Data Structures & Algorithms Course

![Node.js Course](https://i.imgur.com/hmSsAlw.gif)

Node.js isn’t a library – it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, like a food truck that lets a chef cook anywhere instead of just in a kitchen! Highest requested course. (This is also our first Club course.)

#### 🖼 Project Showcase

We redesigned our Project Showcase to feel more like a showcase (switched to a gallery-style presentation that emphasized each project’s cover image while making it clear how to filter by project tags). Added Staff Picks, too. Go and check out some projects!

We redesigned our On-Platform Community aka the OPC! Take a look into our product process, design decisions, and what’s to come. This is the first blog post by Jackie, our product design and UI/UX mastermind behind all the recent revamp.

#### Final Note

To the whole Codédex team, cheers to a phenomenal March, with some team members working around the clock ([sometimes at 5 am](https://x.com/Asiqur14/status/1902031137666453918)) to keep the site up and running.

Even though last month went completely nuclear, it was really the culmination of two and a half years of hard work, persistence, and focus of this small-but-mighty team.

Let’s stay locked in and aim to break even by the end of Q2, so we can continue to push the frontier of online learning and build the platform the world deserves.
As always, my email is sonny@codedex.io if you have any feedback on the product.
