We did it — we clawed our way out of the trenches and are officially [Default Alive](https://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html). 🥲

Last month, we hit another inflection point, and growth is off the charts. **670k unique visitors** came to our website in March and expect the momentum to continue.

The engine’s on and we’re off to the races.

#### 🌟 Product-Market Fit

_“If you have to ask whether you have product-market fit, the answer's no.”_ - Lean Startup

[Product-Market Fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product-market_fit) is often described as an elusive milestone that’s difficult to quantify, but when it happens, it’s unmistakable. This past month, we’ve experienced it firsthand.

Our growth metrics show hockey-stick curves across all the right charts. What once felt like pushing a boulder uphill now feels like being pulled by momentum. 

_We’re no longer second-guessing ourselves._

Learners started coming to us instead of the other way around. Y'all use Codédex, love it, and tell your friends about it (please keep doing so!). The feedback shifted to urgent demands for more content/features and faster updates. The market is responding loudly and enthusiastically, and we’re ready to meet the demand head-on.

#### Final Note

To the whole Codédex team, cheers to a phenomenal March, with some team members working around the clock ([sometimes at 5 am](https://x.com/Asiqur14/status/1902031137666453918)) to keep the site up and running.

Even though last month went completely nuclear, it was really the culmination of two and a half years of hard work, persistence, and focus of this small-but-mighty team.

Let’s stay locked in and aim to reach ramen profitability by the end of Q2, so we can continue to push the frontier of online learning and build the platform the world deserves.
