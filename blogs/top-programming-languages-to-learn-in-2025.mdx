It's 2025, and with the recent developments of AI and web dev, it might seem overwhelming or confusing where to start with programming. What should you be learning to stay current or create that one side project you've always wanted to make? 

Here are the top programming languages that _you_ should be learning in 2025, alongside some other frameworks that could be helpful too! 

I got you. 

## What to Build

![Ellie Popoca](https://i.imgur.com/Vd4GiNg.png)

Hi, my name is [Ellie](https://www.codedex.io/@ellie), and I'm a recent graduate from UIUC. I've been building courses for Codédex (the site you're on now!) for about a year now. In college, I spent a lot of time building web apps and mobile apps for nonprofits and I've learned a thing or two about what programming languages to use for all areas of computer science (aandd maybe went to hackathons here and there… like 20 or so…).

I believe that the best language for you to learn is going to be the one that is most aligned with what you're interested in and what _you_ want to build. But, what is that exactly? Have no idea? 

Here's how I can break it down.

### Web and Mobile Development

For any web application, **HTML/CSS** is going to be what you learn first. These aren't "real" programming languages, but they are what you use to set up a webpage on a browser. Alongside these, you're going to learn **JavaScript**. Not to be confused with Java (JavaScript's evil not twin). 

The HTML/CSS/JS combo is on the beginner side of things if you want to just dabble in what coding could be. JavaScript will help make your webpage pop with cool functionality and features. We have so many examples of this on the Codédex [Projects](https://www.codedex.io/projects) and [Courses](https://www.codedex.io/courses) catalog. 

If you're more on the intermediate side and want to explore something further, learning the **React** library with its framework counterpart, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) will be right up your alley for a challenge. Let me also make a note: **TypeScript**. Thank me later. It's a very popular JavaScript replacement since JS is not a type-based language. TS makes developing larger web apps a lot better as a developer because you _actually_ know what your bugs mean. Probably one of the fastest-growing languages right now. 

Side note: once you get into web/mobile development, you need a way to store user data. This is where databases come in! On Codédex, we have a free course on [SQL](https://www.codedex.io/sql) where you can start learning ASAP!

**Mobile Development**

If you're more into mobile development and want to make an app, it's going to look a little bit different! You have a few different paths here: 

- For iOS apps, **Swift** is your language. Mac, Apple Watch widgets, iPhone, iPad, everything! 
- For Android apps, **Java** is a popular choice, but I'll also suggest **Kotlin**. It's a bit more readable than Java, _and_ is an industry plus (a lot of big tech companies use Kotlin for their Android apps.) 
- While Kotlin can also technically be used for iOS apps, **Flutter* is a popular cross-platform framework, which uses the **Dart** programming language. [Build apps for any screen](https://flutter.dev/) (Their words, not mine).

### AI & Machine Learning

This is a pretty huge one. And we might know the answer already. Whether you want to build models from scratch or use existing ones, **Python** is the most common language mostly because there are so many libraries for AI and machine learning.

**AI**

Is it a hype/fad of the decade or are we all just living in a post-AI world? Only time will tell. After learning the fundamentals of Python, it's good to play around with popular LLMs (large language models) just as OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or even the newly released DeepSeek that's taking the internet by storm. If you want to learn more, check out Codédex's [Gen AI](https://www.codedex.io/gen-ai) course after learning Python!

**Machine Learning**

**PyTorch** is great for research and experimentation, and **TensorFlow** is popular for production-level models. These are both pretty intermediate/advanced libraries, so definitely don't skip learning Python first! Check out the Data Science section below for more!

### Game Development

If you're into building games, this one is for you. There are two main game engines right now: [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US). 

<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", marginTop: "2rem", marginBottom: "-2rem"}}>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/88LzUmM.gif" width="175"/>
</div>

Unity uses the **C#** programming language, while Unreal Engine uses **C++**. You might prefer one game engine over the other, and it's totally your choice, but Fortnite was built with UE and Fall Guys was built with Unity, so… pick your poison.

If you'd rather not build with a game engine, no worries! **JavaScript** has different libraries like [phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to also build games with! 

P.S. I wrote the p5.js course, so lmk what you think!

### Data Science

If you're more into analyzing data, or working with data to visualize information, **Python** is (again) the go-to language. You might hear **R** as a programming language that's also popular, especially if you want to work with more statistic-heavy computation, but you're A-ok with Python as your starting language. (We've found that R is used more in academia, statistics, and research.)

BONUS: look into the top data science-related Python libraries like [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)! 

Another one that is low-key super critical in Data Science interviews is SQL! It's a language that's used to communicate with databases. Check out [Boba Talk episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5NZV2APziWm5RNslrKrniS) with Cat Zhou (former Head of Data at BeReal and Twitter) on why SQL is a must-learn language for Data Analysts and Data Scientists in 2025.

### Literally Anything Else

**Python** and **C++**. 

Python (if it's your first time coding) will be the BEST language to learn first because of how easy it is to read. Fun fact: Python surpassed JS in 2024 for the top programming language on GitHub](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/#the-most-popular-programming-languages). 

```py
print("Howdy, World!") 
```

C++ makes the cut! (while it's a bit harder to read and more "clunky" as a programming language). In the long run, it'll help you fundamentally understand what is happening behind the scenes when code runs and compiles. 

## WHERE DO I LEARN? 

You made it to the end! And well, you're on [codedex.io](https://www.codedex.io/home) right now! This means you get access _immediately_ to over half of our course catalog (it's FREE!).
