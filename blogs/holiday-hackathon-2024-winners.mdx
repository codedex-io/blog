**Website:** https://warfarian.github.io/better-call-saul 🌱
**Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub Pages
**Prize:** Apple Watch (10th gen)

While deceptively simple at first glance, the judges quickly realized that this checked all the boxes in an e-commerce store. "I think this one is just rock solid. Can't do much more in 24 hrs." - one of the web dev judges. Great landing page with FAQs and About page with video; it's mobile responsive and even has a search bar. Congrats, Code Riders!

The cute intro screen and the bubble heads say it all... you're invited to a DIY stoop sale! And sometimes less is more, a one-pager with a jazzy BGM and a cardboard background that ties it together. Lil & Chelsea loved that this won!
