## Introduction

**Game Development** has been the way many people (maybe even you!) have gotten interested in programming. While it can be chalenging, it‚Äôs also one of the most rewarding ways to see your progress come to life. You might‚Äôve even written a Minecraft mod or two back in the day.

My name is **Ellie**, and I‚Äôm a Curriculum Developer @ Cod√©dex, and studied **Game Design** in college. I created this guide if you‚Äôre learning to code or already know how, and want to dive into the world of game dev. Unity or Unreal? C# or C++? Indie or AAA? 2D or 3D? 

I‚Äôll answer all of your burning questions and help you get started on your game dev journey! üïπÔ∏è

## Beyond the programming

Something we might often not realize that there are so many moving parts to making games. 

Beyond the programming, there‚Äôs music, assets, art, movement, animation, sound effects, and so much more. It gets especially complicated with open world games for example. 

![image](https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/Example%281%29_0.gif)

Know that as a solo developer, depending on the game that you decide to make, you‚Äôre in charge of *all* of these things when you‚Äôre putting your project together. You might not want music, but you‚Äôll need art or sounds to add flair to your game. 

## Where to Start

![image](https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20190627/learn/images/df6139ce-7d28-4d7d-bd1d-29046d2f84c7_Screen_Shot_2019_06_27_at_10.58.53_AM.png)

One of the main questions to ask yourself is, _where do you want to start_? 

The earliest memory I have of building a game is when I built a plant growth simulator to feed plants using a JavaScript library called p5.js. It had music, small animations, and sprites‚Ä¶ I was going for a cozy aesthetic, all with my own art too!

But where to start depends on where you‚Äôre at in skill level, and what you want to build. 

Here are some places where I would recommend starting. Remember that if something doesn‚Äôt feel challenging enough, you can always add more to anything you‚Äôre working on. We‚Äôll talk about tools and engines soon! 

- **If you‚Äôre a beginner coder**, you may have just finished a course on Cod√©dex, or you finished your first CS class, you might want to start with a library or framework and learn the concepts of game dev first. Trust me, it's so much easier when you can just add assets with one line of code instead of trying to figure out how to make an animation move in 30 different ways with 100 different buttons. You‚Äôll learn the logic without all the hassle. 
- **If you‚Äôre starting to get comfortable** or have built a game beforehand, you might be curious about a game engine! This is ideal if you have an idea you want to make come to life, or you‚Äôre simply up for the challenge.

## Libraries and Frameworks

Let's talk tools! Game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine are probably the most popular when you think of game development. But these tools require you to already know C#, C++, or another scripting language. These will also typically have things like physics systems built into them, rather than having to manually code a bunch of things through an IDE. I‚Äôll go through my favorite tools here, but I will provide some other options for you to explore and do other research. 

Web game enthusiast? This one is for you. A JavaScript library is going to be the easiest way to make and share your game online and turn it into a web game for you and your friends to play! Here are some of my recommendations.

### Phaser (JavaScript)

### Pygame (Python)

![pygame](https://i.imgur.com/j9HLJ4d.gif)

**Pygame** is a free and open-source [Python](https://codedex.io/python) library used to make video games. It‚Äôs built on top of the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library and provides tools for handling graphics, sound, and user input ‚Äì all in pure Python. With Pygame, you can create 2D games like platformers, puzzles, or arcade classics, and it‚Äôs often one of the first libraries beginner game developers use to bring their ideas to life.

## Game Engines

<Quote text="Your engine choice depends heavily on the context. Don‚Äôt use Godot 4 if you want to make a mobile browser game! Unity is great for 3D games, GameMaker is great for new programmers, and Love2D is for anyone wanting complete control over every pixel. I just happened to like Godot. - Chris and Judy Makes Games"/>

There are several options for you to choose from. I‚Äôll start from the ones I have the most experience with, and even include some games that were made with each! 

### Godot

![image](https://gameworldobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/godot-4-tiles.gif)

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is a free, open-source game engine that supports both 2D and 3D game development. 

It uses **GDScript**, a Python-like language, and has a user-friendly editor! Games like Hollow Knight and Cuphead were made with Godot! I used this for a class and built out a full game with a few levels with my project group. Overall, I liked it and will probably use it to make a game in the future. Do note that it took a while to learn all the UI for this, and I was stuck watching tutorials for a while.

### Unity

![image](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/unity-muse-features-expanded-in-editor-with-3-new-updates/Images/Animate-Edit_Gif_2.gif)

[Unity](https://unity.com/) is one of the most popular game engines in the industry! It supports 2D, 3D, and mobile games across multiple platforms. Unit uses **C#** for its scripts, and can publish to PC, consoles, mobile, and web. Games made with Unity include Pok√©mon Go, Genshin Impact, and Among Us. Not recommended for beginners, but if you‚Äôre up for the challenge, this would be the best option for a high-quality 2D Steam game. 


### Unreal Engine

![image](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/controlrig-timelapse-01-190226799.gif?resize=1&w=1920)

[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) is a powerful engine primarily used for high-end 3D games. It features advanced graphics, physics, and tools for creating very high-quality visual games. You can code in [C++](https://codedex.io/cpp) or use Blueprints (visual scripting). Games made with Unreal Engine include Fortnite, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Street Fighter 6. Perfect for a top-tier 3D game you‚Äôre hoping to build, or to learn a game engine on. 

### Roblox Studio

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Roblox_Studio_logo_2021_present.svg/1200px-Roblox_Studio_logo_2021_present.svg.png" width="20%" />

[Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/landing) is a free platform for creating multiplayer games that run on the Roblox platform. Games are built with Lua/Luau scripting and have built-in multiplayer support. Players access your game through the Roblox app, where millions of players gather, and with the opportunity to monetize.

### Honorable Mentions

Of course, there are so many ways to get started besides the software that I have shown, so here are a few different options that I haven‚Äôt personally used, but could be helpful for the game you‚Äôre trying to make! 

- [Game Maker](https://gamemaker.io/en): A great place to start with learning a game engine, and uses GML scripting, perfect for 2D games
- [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/): Has a lot of built-in mechanics to start building a typical RPG game, and uses Java/Ruby depending on your version
- [Twine](https://twinery.org/): A choose your own adventure text based game editor that uses JavaScript!

## Art and Assets

No game is complete without art and assets! Art is a big part of what a game really is, and while you may be inclined to focus on the art and assets that a game can have, note that there are a lot of resources online to help! 

Here are some places where to find spritesheets for characters, tilesheets, music, and more that are open source, and free to use! Note that some game engines might also have their own asset stores that sell or provide assets for you.

- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets/free) 
- [gamesart2D](https://www.gameart2d.com/)

## Publishing

And of course, what‚Äôs a game good for if people can‚Äôt play it !? Depending on what you use to build your game with, you have several publishing and upload options. 

- **L√ñVE2D Games:** You can distribute your game as a standalone executable for Windows, Mac, or Linux. Upload to platforms like [itch.io](https://itch.io/), GitHub, or your own website for free distribution. 
- **Godot Games:** Export to Windows, Mac, Linux, web browsers, iOS, and Android. Publish on itch.io, Steam, Google Play Store, or Apple App Store, depending on your platform.
- **Unity Games:** Supports PC (Steam, Epic Games Store), consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch), mobile (iOS, Android), and web. Publish through each platform's respective store or upload to itch.io for indie distribution.
- **Unreal Engine Games:** Targets PC and consoles through Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Nintendo eShop. Also supports mobile and VR platforms.

## The Community

Nothing like the game dev community to keep you accountable! It‚Äôs so easy to sometimes lose track of your progress or time spent on your game or what you‚Äôre making, especially as a solo developer! The Cod√©dex community, for instance, has a ton of support that we‚Äôre offering to those interested in game development! 

**Cod√©dex Project Showcase**: There's now a (Game) tag for all the community projects!
