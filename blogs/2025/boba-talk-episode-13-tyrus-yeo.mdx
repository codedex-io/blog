New episode! **Ep. #13 with Tyrus Yeo, Founding Engineer @ Ditto** is now live. üéôÔ∏è

What does it take to go from coding your first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in a college CS class to becoming a founding engineer at one of the hottest NYC consumer startups? 

In this episode, I sat down (in the Cod√©dex office!) with [Tyrus Yeo](linkedin.com/in/tyrus-yeo), a University of Michigan grad who left Hong Kong, dove headfirst into computer science, and carved his own path into the world of tech startups.

Wed talked about the importance of taking that one intro coding class, what it‚Äôs like to hustle for that first tech internship (including an 800-word midnight email!), how to figure out whether you‚Äôre mission-driven or tech-driven in your career, the gap between CS education and real-world engineer work, and things you can do to make lasting connections in college. 

This episode is a must-listen **for CS students and recent Gen Z grads**. üíå
