Back with another episode! Ep. #13 with Tyrus Yeo is now live. üéôÔ∏è

What does it take to go from coding your first ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in a college CS class to becoming a founding engineer at one of the hottest upcoming NYC consumer startup? 

In this episode,, I sat down (in the Cod√©dex office!) with [Tyrus Yeo](linkedin.com/in/tyrus-yeo), a University of Michigan grad who left Hong Kong, dove headfirst into computer science, and carved his own path into the world of tech startups.

Wed talked about the importance of taking that one intro coding class, what it‚Äôs like to hustle for that very first tech internship (including an 800-word midnight email!), how to figure out whether you‚Äôre mission-driven or tech-driven in your career, the gap between CS education and real-world software engineering, and things you can do to make lasting connections in college. 

From startup culture to learning React on the fly, this episode is a must-listen for CS students and recent Gen Z grads. üíå
