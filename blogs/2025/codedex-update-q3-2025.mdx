New achievement unlocked: 1m registered users. 

It took us three years to get here but we here.

In August, we shared our v1.0 update as well as the GitHub Copilot. So what else happened in Q3?

We’ll keep this short since things have been going well.

Thanks to strong growth, we just had our **lowest net burn** in two years (since July 2023 🥲). We also signed a lease for a bigger office as we prep for the next few months. 

Making some moves.

## Global Search

Immediately after the v1.0 launch, we shipped out the global search.

That’s right! We gave our [Monthly Challenge](https://www.codedex.io/community/monthly-challenge) page a makeover. Now it’s easier than ever to browse, filter, and get inspired by the current and past challenges.

Here's what's new:

- Courses
- Project Tutorials
- Users

    display: "flex",

We pride ourselves on shipping fast – sometimes too fast. In the past 12 months, our userbase has grown 5x, so it was time to take a step back and take a hard look at where we are burning cash, especially on the IT & infrastructure side.

Key optimizations:

- Google Cloud: Improved Firebase usage by 56%. Saved ~$7,450/month.
- OpenAI: Replaced LLM-based checks with regex. Saved ~$900/month.

Total saved: \$8,350/month! Enough for a new hire or 2,087 Wendy's 4 for \$4. 🍔

Shoutout to [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma) for making these improvements!

## Final Thoughts

Get ready for our v1.0 launch in late July!

It’s been exactly three years since I left Codecademy after the Skillsoft acquisition. I didn’t know what would come next – only that I needed to build something new and lasting in this space, with a team that is just as wild and ambitious as me.

Since starting Codédex, we've been so heads-down building that we haven't properly launched the product since our scrappy MVP debut on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/codedex) in November 2022. I rewatched the video today – it's almost unrecognizable. We've grown up.

But now, the question is no longer _“Will we make it?”_ but _“What kind of company do we want to become?”_ and _“How can we be so impactful, so transformative, that we shift the trajectory of this planet for the better?”_

To get there, we're going back to the drawing board. 

Here's our plan: 1) craft our mission statement and story, 2) reintroduce Codédex to the world, and 3) launch the manifesto this fall as our answer to the times.

The future's v bright.
