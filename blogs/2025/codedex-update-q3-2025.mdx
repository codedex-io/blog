Howdy! 

It's your boy Sonny. Can't believe it is Fall already.

Like most tech startups, the Codédex team run on a rhythm of 🎯 **Quarterly OKRs** → ✅ **Weekly Goals** → 🔥 **Daily Standups**. And there are four quarters in a year.

If you've been following us closely, we shared our [Codédex v1.0](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-v1) update in August and the [GitHub Copilot Partnership](https://www.codedex.io/blog/github-copilot-partnership) in September. But what else happened in Q3?

Here’s a quick recap of everything we’ve released from July to September.

## 🔎 Global Search

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/WxRVvfV.gif)

Right after the v1.0 launch, we rolled out global search! Over the past few months, many of you have asked for an easier way to **find friends** on Codédex – so we made it happen. Now, search is available right from the global header, accessible from any page outside the LE.

A search bar tends to bring a whole new layer of depth to a product, which I love~

You can now search across:

- 📚 Courses
- 📝 Project Tutorials
- 👤 Users

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">Try out Global Search</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## 🪄 Meet Lumi – Your New AI Code Companion

![Lumi GIF](https://i.imgur.com/BUOGzzp.gif)

Say hello to **Lumi**, your new AI code companion! We completely revamped our AI feature and Lumi is now available in all courses (except those without a code editor). 🧚

Your AI chat history is saved for one week, so you can easily revisit past questions. Currently, Clubbers enjoy **unlimited questions**, while free users get 5 a day. Use them wisely!

To help you get started, we’ve also included these one-click prompts:

- ✨ Tell me more about this concept
- ✨ Provide step-by-step instructions
- ✨ Get feedback on your code

**Note:** You’ll unlock Lumi once you reach 500 XP.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",

    transform: "scale(.9)",

## 🎓 Course Certificates Glow Up

![certificats](https://i.imgur.com/uvH5tTW.png)

Since we launched cerficates in August 2023 (see the [original blog post](https://www.codedex.io/blog/certificates)), we've issued over **6,100 course certificates** through Accredible. Internally, Naomi has been pushing for a visual refresh since so many people are sharing them on LinkedIn, and the original design no longer feels on-brand. So, Jackie worked her usual magic, and here are the new certificates for Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Java (new!).

Your resume, personal portfolio, and LinkedIn are always evolving, so be sure to add these certificates early in your learning journey!

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7382431438110920705-P30S"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See example on LinkedIn</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## ⚙️ Account Settings Revamp

![account settings GIF](https://i.imgur.com/yWqrfzZ.gif)

Another remaining revamp was the **/account** page. We’ve fixed a few UI/UX pitfalls – like entering full social URLs instead of slugs – and added improvements such as an easier way to switch between monthly and annual plans, email newsletter settings, and more!

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io/account"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">Check account settings</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## Growth

![growth](https://i.imgur.com/ewNxW8t.jpeg)

We started the year with 250,000 registered users and today, we are at 1,250,000! **That's 1 million new users in just 9 months.** 2025 has been absolutely giving so far. 

As we tunnel-vision on retention in Q4, all the hard work is starting to pay off. We’re fighting asymmetrically against the incumbents who had a 10-year head start... and closing the gap.

## First Ever Team Onsite

![Picnic](https://i.imgur.com/9OdWgCE.png)

Dharma was in the U.S.! So we brought the whole team to NYC (Eric from Houston, Ellie from Chicago, Colin from Jersey) for the first time ever. Some of us had never met each other IRL!

We launched v1.0 together, had a team picnic in Prospect Park, went live on Instagram, recorded 2 episodes of Boba Talk, sang our hearts out at karaoke, and just [locked in](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOCEo-9DxF0) overall.

Take a look at some moments (and maybe cry with us 🥹):
