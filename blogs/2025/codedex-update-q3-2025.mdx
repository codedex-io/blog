Howdy! 👋

Codédex team run on a rhythm of 🎯 **Quarterly OKRs** → ✅ **Weekly Goals** → 🔥 **Daily Standups**.

If you've been following us closedly, we shared our [Codédex v1.0](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-v1) update in August and the [GitHub Copilot Partnership](https://www.codedex.io/blog/github-copilot-partnership) in September. But what else happened in Q3?

Here’s a quick recap of everything we’ve released from July to September.

## 🔎 Global Search

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/WxRVvfV.gif)

Right after the v1.0 launch, we rolled out global search! OOver the past few months, many of you have asked for an easier way to find friends on Codédex – so we made it happen. Now, search is available right from the global header, accessible from any page outside the learning environment.

This feature adds a whole new layer of depth to the product and changes the feel of the product.

You can now search across:

- 📚 Courses
- 📝 Project Tutorials
- 👤 Users

## Growth


## Team Onsite

We pride ourselves on shipping fast – sometimes too fast. In the past 12 months, our userbase has grown 5x, so it was time to take a step back and take a hard look at where we are burning cash, especially on the IT & infrastructure side.

Key optimizations:

- Google Cloud: Improved Firebase usage by 56%. Saved ~$7,450/month.
- OpenAI: Replaced LLM-based checks with regex. Saved ~$900/month.

Total saved: \$8,350/month! Enough for a new hire or 2,087 Wendy's 4 for \$4. 🍔

Shoutout to [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma) for making these improvements!
