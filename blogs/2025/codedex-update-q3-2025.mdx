Howdy! 👋

It's your boy Sonny. Can't believe it is Fall already.

Like most tech startups, the Codédex team run on a rhythm of 🎯 **Quarterly OKRs** → ✅ **Weekly Goals** → 🔥 **Daily Standups**. And there are four quarters in a year.

If you've been following us closely, we shared our [Codédex v1.0](https://www.codedex.io/blog/codedex-v1) update in August and the [GitHub Copilot Partnership](https://www.codedex.io/blog/github-copilot-partnership) in September. But what else happened in Q3?

Here’s a quick recap of everything we’ve released from July to September.

## 🔎 Global Search

![Global Search GIF](https://i.imgur.com/WxRVvfV.gif)

Right after the v1.0 launch, we rolled out global search! Over the past few months, many of you have asked for an easier way to **find friends** on Codédex – so we made it happen. Now, search is available right from the global header, accessible from any page outside the LE.

A search bar tends to bring a whole new layer of depth to a product, which I love~

You can now search across:

- 📚 Courses
- 📝 Project Tutorials
- 👤 Users

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">Try out Global Search</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## 🪄 Meet Lumi – Your New AI Code Companion

![Lumi GIF](https://i.imgur.com/BUOGzzp.gif)

Say hello to **Lumi**, your new AI code companion! We completely revamped our AI feature and Lumi is now availabe in all courses (except those without a code editor). 🧚

Your AI chat history is saved for one week, so you can easily revisit past questions. Currently, Clubbers enjoy **unlimited questions**, while free users get 5 a day. Use them wisely!

To get started, here are a few one-click prompts we’ve set up for you:

- ✨ Tell me more about this concept
- ✨ Provide step-by-step instructions
- ✨ Get feedback on your code

**Note:** You’ll unlock Lumi once you reach 500 XP.

<div
  style={{

    <Button variant="yellow">Chat with Lumi</Button>

## 🎓 Course Certificates Glow Up

![certificats](https://i.imgur.com/uvH5tTW.png)

Since we launched cerficates in August 2023 (see the [original blog post](https://www.codedex.io/blog/certificates)), we've issued over **6,100 course certificates** through Accredible. Internally, Naomi has been pushing for a visual refresh since so many people are sharing them on LinkedIn, and the current design no longer feels on-brand. So, Jackie worked her usual magic, and here are the new certificates for Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Java (new!).

Your resume, personal portfolio, and LinkedIn are always evolving, so be sure to add these certificates early in your learning journey!

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7382431438110920705-P30S"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">See example on LinkedIn</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## ⚙️ Account Settings Revamp

![account settings GIF](https://i.imgur.com/yWqrfzZ.gif)

Another remaining revamp is the **/account** page. We’ve fixed a few UI/UX pitfalls – like entering full social URLs instead of slugs – and added improvements such as an easier way to switch between monthly and annual plans, email newsletter settings, and more!

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
    marginBottom: "1.2rem",
    transform: "scale(.9)",
  }}
>
  <a
    href="https://www.codedex.io/account"
    style={{ all: "unset" }}
    target="_blank"
    and
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
  >
    <Button variant="yellow">Check account settings</Button>
  </a>
</div>

## Growth


## Team Onsite

![Burning money gif](https://i.imgur.com/vI0koYT.jpeg)

We pride ourselves on shipping fast – sometimes too fast. In the past 12 months, our userbase has grown 5x, so it was time to take a step back and take a hard look at where we are burning cash, especially on the IT & infrastructure side.

Key optimizations:

- Google Cloud: Improved Firebase usage by 56%. Saved ~$7,450/month.
- OpenAI: Replaced LLM-based checks with regex. Saved ~$900/month.

Total saved: \$8,350/month! Enough for a new hire or 2,087 Wendy's 4 for \$4. 🍔

Shoutout to [Dharma](https://www.codedex.io/@dharma) for making these improvements!
