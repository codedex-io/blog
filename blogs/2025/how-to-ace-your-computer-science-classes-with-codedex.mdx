**Hey everyone!** It's Ellie. üëã Chances are, you're a Computer Science student right now a few weeks into learning how to code in your CS classes, or you're in the final years of school trying to refresh the fundamentals and just make it out alive~

Look no further, because Cod√©dex is the perfect complement to your CS journey ‚Äì making tough classes fun and helping you **ace all your exams and school projects**.

## The Current CS Landscape

![tiktok comment](https://i.imgur.com/GRA9EB8.png)

Before we get started, let‚Äôs take a look at the current landscape.

In 2025, the **[dropout rate for CS students hit 10.7%](https://missiongraduatenm.org/college-dropout-statistics)**, highest among all college majors. üò±

This shouldn‚Äôt be surprising, we all know someone who switched majors... because CS can feel **impossibly hard** (and sometimes so boring lol). Here's why:

- üßóüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steep learning curve
- üìö Overwhelming workload / math-heavy
- ü´£ Poor preparation
- ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lack of support
- ‚ò†Ô∏è Or worst of all: professors who can't teach

Combine this with the gap between traditional education and real-world skills, plus a down cycle in the job market, and you know why you have to be on your A-game!

But don‚Äôt sweat. We‚Äôve got you. Here's how to use Cod√©dex if you‚Äôre a CS student. ‚ú®

## Courses

### Intro to Programming / CS 101

![Intro to CS Language by College in 2025](https://i.imgur.com/qFLfsT0.gif)

Taking your first fundamental CS class? This is where a lot of student get their first real taste of algorithmic thinking. If you're not one of those kids who's been coding since age 10, you should _definitely_ be actively practicing outside of class. 

If your teacher explained a concept weirdly in class, and you're still confused (i.e. _where do I even use a while loop_...), Cod√©dex has you covered with our intro courses!

Each Cod√©dex intro course will have **4 fundamentals, and 4 additional basics**:

  - **Fundamentals:** Hello World, Variables, Control Flow, Loops
  - **Additional Basics:** Lists/Arrays, Functions & Methods, Classes & Objects, etc.
    
Whether your school teaches CS 101 in Python, C/C++, or Java, we've got you covered: 

- üêç Python ‚û°Ô∏è https://codedex.io/python
- ‚òïÔ∏è Java ‚û°Ô∏è https://codedex.io/java
- üíª C/C++ ‚û°Ô∏è https://codedex.io/cpp

### Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

DSA is another core CS class and often a [weeder course](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weeder_course) for CS majors. These classes are notoriously tough, and many students fail because they don't have enough hands-on practice with the concepts and professors tend to move fast.

This is why we highly recommend taking DSA and using YouTube:

### Database Systems

Most schools teach databases through textbooks, meaning you often write queries _on paper_ instead of on the computer, without understanding the practical application. I'm sometimes shocked that students get even a C in that database class because we have the perfect course for you:

- üõ¢Ô∏è SQL ‚û°Ô∏è https://codedex.io/sql 

### What School DOES NOT teach you! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/aWpf3eP.png)

Remember, Computer Science != Software Engineering.

Your CS classes are going to teach you some of the concepts that, while important, aren't always applicable to what you'll be doing as a Software Engineer or as a technologist. Not only that, they won't cover a lot of the different technologies that tech companies are using to build or mainatain web/mobile/desktop apps. 

We're here to bridge that gap and teach you some of the real-world things you won't ever cover throughout your CS degree: 

- **Web Development:** We have the Web Development track where you can learn [HTML](https://codedex.io/html) ‚Üí [CSS](https://codedex.io/css) ‚Üí [JavaScript](https://codedex.io/javascript) ‚Üí [Command Line](https://www.codedex.io/command-line) ‚Üí [Git & GitHub](https://www.codedex.io/git-github) ‚Üí [React](https://www.codedex.io/react) courses.
- **Data Science:** Typically, your CS classes won't go down a specific data science track. On Cod√©dex, learn Python ‚Üí [NumPy](https://codedex.io/numpy) ‚Üí [Pandas](https://codedex.io/pandas) ‚Üí Matplotlib (coming this fall) ‚Üí [Machine Learning](https://codedex.io/machine-learning) to get a head start on learning more data-heavy concepts.
- **Game Development:** For students interested in game dev but are intimidated by Unreal/Unity, check out our new [Lua](https://codedex.io/lua) and [Phaser](https://codedex.io/phaser) for a smoother buildup.

## Extra Practice

Cod√©dex gives you a few ways to practice your coding skills *outside* of class if you're interested in going above and beyond coursework. 

### Challenge Packs

![Challenge Packs](https://i.imgur.com/kdCDmdo.png)

Challenge Packs are available for Python and JavaScript (more coming soon!). Think LeetCode-style practice problems if those are still too hard. Challenge yourself with a few of these if you want to reach mastery on concepts like Control Flow, Loops, and Lists.

</div>

### Project Tutorials

![Project Tutorials](https://i.imgur.com/IcSfjq2.png)

Here at Cod√©dex, we believe in learning by doing. Check out all the fun, outside-the-box projects we have for just about anything! They're organized by language and difficulty, so there's always something you can do that matches your skill level. 

These are perfect real-world projects to add to your portfolio. üòé

## Cheatsheets

![Cheatsheets](https://i.imgur.com/soEbhSD.png)

Don't forget about cheatsheets. We have unlockable cheatsheets at the end of our courses. Here are three examples:

- [Python](https://www.codedex.io/assets/python-basics-1.pdf)
- [C++](https://www.codedex.io/assets/cpp-basics-1.pdf)
- [Java](https://www.codedex.io/assets/java-basics-1.pdf)

If there's one resource you'll use out of this guide, it's this one. Hang these cheatsheets up on your wall, tape them to your notebook, or keep them in a folder on your computer. These are super helpful for when you need to go back and reference. 

## Community
