## Tell us about yourself!

Hi everyone! My name is [Alan Geirnaert](https://www.codedex.io/@gntalan), and I'm a 25-year-old Fullstack Software Developer Intern at App’Ines, in France. My story officially started in June 2024, just a year and a half ago. At the time, I was a regular guy working in a sunglasses store in Menton, south of France. 

Deep down, I knew that my situation wasn’t what I wanted. I had no degree, no experience, no particular skills… and honestly, no real ambition. 

## So what happened?

On a beautiful Saturday morning, a friendly client walked into the store. We started chatting and he told me he was a developer and (these were his exact words) “PHP is the future!” 

As insane as it sounds, a few minutes later, purely out of curiosity, I typed “PHP” into the search bar. And then… I started crying. What… is this… monstrosity? So I tried again: “Easy coding language.” BOOM. First result: [Codédex | Learn Python](https://www.codedex.io/python). Little did I know, that click would completely change my life. 

I started learning Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and earned the certifications. I couldn’t stop. I even brought my tablet to work so I could keep coding whenever the store was empty. 

Then I discovered [Codédex’s community](https://www.codedex.io/community). And wow. Just... wow. 

I was welcomed as if I had always been part of the family. I also met Eric, Community Manager at Codédex, who gave me valuable insights on my course projects (I still remember [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)!). But the moment everything clicked, the moment I thought, “OK, this is what I want to do for the rest of my life,” was in July 2024, when Codédex announced their [Summer Hackathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaOlDEIkz0I). 

I was only one month into learning. I had no idea what a hackathon even was… but I jumped in anyway. I teamed up with two friends I had met shortly before the event, and we gave it our best shot. We didn’t win, but I had one of the best experiences of my life. That hackathon changed me. It pushed me to start coding all day long. 

My girlfriend was working, so I left my job for what turned out to be a fake internship (I had no idea at the time). When I found out, it was too late, but I refused to let that be the end of the story. That’s when my “RUSH” phase began. I started coding 14–16 hours a day, 7 days a week. I couldn’t think about anything else. I completed every Codédex course exercise, project tutorial, code challenge, anything that existed on the platform. 

And it paid off. 

Five months later, after everything I had built, I landed a real internship as a Fullstack Software Developer and was accepted into a Master’s degree in Software Development through a PLA. 

Yay! 🥲

Not even two weeks later, Codédex announced their [Holiday Hackathon 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toWMpKZxX1M), and I had a revenge to take. One of the challenges was to redesign a modern company’s website as if it were built in the 90s. As a lifelong space enthusiast, I chose NASA. And guess what... I won! I couldn’t believe my eyes. It felt unreal. Today, I’m one year into my internship, nearly finished with my degree, and full of new opportunities. Last year, I was selected as a Global Nominee at NASA Space Apps Zurich, and this year I had the honor of being a speaker at NASA Space Apps Lucerne in Switzerland. And so much more is coming. 

But everything traces back to the exact moment I started coding on Codédex. So yes, it might sound cliché, but I can safely say that Codédex is the reason I’m a developer today. Thank you.

## What was your goal when you first started?

When I started learning to code, my goal wasn’t to become a developer. I just wanted to find my place in the world. I felt like I didn’t belong anywhere, and I hoped coding would help me discover what I was meant to do. It turned out to be the passion I had been searching for!

## What was your biggest challenge in reaching your goal? How did you overcome them?

My biggest challenge was time. I was working full-time, and by the time I got home, I was exhausted. Staying consistent and keeping up with learning wasn’t easy. Another friction point was simply not knowing where to start; what tools to use, which language to learn first, and what direction to follow. Everything felt overwhelming at the beginning.

I pushed through by being extremely consistent. Even when I came home exhausted, I’d try to learn just a little bit every day. I used every free moment I had: breaks, slow days at work, evenings, to keep progressing. Finding Codédex really helped me overcome the confusion of “where do I start?” Their courses and community gave me structure, motivation, and a sense of belonging, which kept me moving forward when things got difficult.

## How did you stay motivated in reaching your goals?

I stayed motivated by holding onto the vision of who I wanted to become. Coding gave me a sense of direction I had never felt before, and each small achievement, each solved bug, each completed challenge, reinforced that I was on the right path. What truly kept me going, though, was the community. Codédex made me feel supported, seen, and encouraged at every step. When you’re surrounded by people who genuinely believe in your potential, it becomes much easier to believe in yourself !

## What’s the best part of your internship?

The best part of my success is everything I’m doing right now in the space innovation world in Switzerland. Coding really opened doors I never imagined. Today, I’m involved in space hackathons, collaborating with organizations in the Swiss space ecosystem, and even getting opportunities to speak at events like NASA Space Apps Lucerne. Being able to contribute to real space-related projects, meet researchers, innovators, and passionate people… that’s something my past self would have never believed possible. And it all started the day I decided to learn how to code.

## If you could build one piece of fictional tech into reality, what would it be?

I would build a quantum-powered portable computer. 

Something small enough to hold in your hand, but powerful enough to simulate gravitational fields, predict orbital trajectories, or run complex physics models in real time. It would be the ultimate tool for space innovation, research, and problem-solving!

## What advice would you give to someone starting out?

Trust. The. Process. But more than that, trust yourself, even when you have absolutely no clue what you’re doing. You don’t need to feel ready. You don’t need to be talented from day one. You don’t need the perfect setup, the perfect plan, or the perfect timing. 

I started coding on a tablet in a sunglasses store during quiet hours. If that taught me anything, it’s this: If you show up every single day, even tired, even lost, even doubting, life will move out of your way. You’ll learn faster than you think. You’ll surprise yourself. You’ll build things you didn’t believe you were capable of. And one day, without even noticing it, you’ll look back and realize: “Oh. I became the person I was chasing.” 

So start now. Start small. Start messy. But start, and don’t stop. Because the moment you choose to trust the process... that’s the moment everything begins.

_“My first ever deployed project, made for my HTML certification on Codedex.”_

## If you had a magic wand to change anything about Codédex, what would you do?

If I had a magic wand, I wouldn’t change Codédex, I’d amplify it. I’d make sure every lost, confused, or stuck person in the world somehow finds their way to this platform, the same way I did. You have no idea how many lives you’re silently changing. 

Thank you for changing mine.
