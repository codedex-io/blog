The newest **Boba Talk episode #14** is now live, made especially for students currently studying computer science! If that’s you, listen up!

In this episode, we recorded the CS panel we hosted live on Discord stages with: 

- ​👩‍💻 Yna Pangilinan (Data Science Intern at TD Bank)
- 🧑‍💻 Santiago Carena (Software Engineer at Microsoft)
- ​👩‍💻 Emma Tung (Software Engineer at Atlassian)

This was an event hosted by the Codédex team specifically for tech students looking to go into software engineering! Yna is a current student while Santiago and Emma are full-timers who provided different perspectives into what they do/did in their roles! 

During our talk, we revealed how to land an internship and full-time offers in the current market, and what AI projects and technologies they’re currently working on. We also were able to reveal some resumes during the panel to know how to structure your own.  👀

We hope this episode gives you some insight into navigating the current tech market!
