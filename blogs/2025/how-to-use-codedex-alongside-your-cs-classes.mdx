Hey everyone! It's Ellie, and chances are, you're a Computer Science student right now a few weeks into learning how to code in your CS classes, or you're in the last couple years of school hoping to just graduate and refresh yourself on all the fundamentals! 

Look no further because Cod√©dex is here to help you supplement brutal CS classes with fun, interactive features to make your class experience a bit less... terrifying.  

## Computer Science Majors

In 2025, the dropout rate for CS students was reported at **10.7%** , making it the highest among all college majors. üò± ([Mission: Graduate](https://missiongraduatenm.org/college-dropout-statistics))

This should not come as a surprise, because I think we all know someone that switched majors... The CS classes and exams are so darn hard. We believe this is mainly because:

- Steep learning curve
- Overwhelming workload
- Math heavy
- Inteadequate support
- Poor preparation

But that doesn't need to be the case! We want to help you get through your CS classes with a bit more ease. So let's get into it.

## Courses

### Intro Programming / CS 101

Are you taking any fundamental CS classes?

Each Cod√©dex course will have **4 fundamentals, and 4 additional basics**:
  - Hello World, Variables, Control Flow, Loops
  - Depending on the course: Lists/Arrays, Functions, Methods, Classes & Objects, etc.
    
So if your teacher explained a concept weirldy in class, and you still don't understand (i.e. where do i even use a while loop...), Cod√©dex will most likely cover that topic in our intro course!

This is where a lot of student get their first exposure to algorithmic thinking. Many students fail if they don't actively practice coding outside class. 

Whether your school teaches Python, Java, or C++, we got you covered: 

- Python: https://codedex.io/python
- Java: https://codedex.io/java
- C++: https://codedex.io/cpp

### Data Structures & Algorithms: 

For the more *advanced* learners (second or third year students), Cod√©dex offers Club only courses.

This is a classic [weeder course](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/weeder_course) for CS majors. These classes are notoriously hard, and many students fail because they don't have enough practice with the concepts.

- Data Structures and 

### Database

Most schools teach databases through textbook and you have to write queries without typing that out.

- SQL: https://codedex.io/sql 

### Machine Learning

### What School DOES NOT teach you! 
![](https://i.imgur.com/aWpf3eP.png)

Your CS classes are going to teach you some of the concepts that, while important, aren't always applicable to what you'll be doing as a Software Engineer or as a technologist. Not only that, they won't cover a lot of the different technologies that tech companies these days are using to build applications or maintain software. 

Cod√©dex is here to bridge that gap and teach you some of the real-world things you won't ever cover throughout your CS degree: 

- **Web Development:** We have the Web Development track where you can learn our introductory [HTML], [CSS], and [JavaScript] courses, as well as [Command Line], [Git & GitHub], [Node.JS] and [React] courses.
- **Data Science:** Typically, your CS classes won't go down a specific data science track. On Cod√©dex, learn [SQL], [NumPy], [Pandas], Matplotlib (coming this fall) to get a head start on learning more data-heavy concepts.

## Cheatsheets

First things first, we got you with cheatsheets. Cod√©dex provides cheatsheets for the **three** most common intro computer science classes. 
- [Python 1](https://www.codedex.io/assets/python-basics-1.pdf)
- [Python 2](https://www.codedex.io/assets/python-basics-2.pdf)
- [C++](https://www.codedex.io/assets/cpp-basics-1.pdf)
- [Java](https://www.codedex.io/assets/java-basics-1.pdf)

If there's one resource you'll use out of this guide, it's this one. Hang these cheatsheets up on your wall, tape them to your notebook, or keep them in a folder on your computer. These are super helpful for when you need to go back and reference. 
## Extra Practice
Cod√©dex gives you a few ways to practice your coding skills *outside* of class if you're interested in going above and beyond coursework. 

### 1. Challenge Packs

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lfg50P4.png)
Challenge packs are available for JavaScript and Python. Think leetcode-style practice problems. Challenge yourself with a few of these if you want to reach mastery on concepts like Loops, Lists, and Control flow.

### 2. Project Tutorials

Here at Cod√©dex, we believe in learning by doing. Check out all the fun, outside-the-box projects we have for just about anything! They're organized by language and difficulty, so there's always something you can do that matches your skill level. 

These are perfect real-world projects to add to your portfolio.

PLUS: We also have a "students' favorites" section so you can see what projects students specifically are making. Immediately after, add these to your resume. üòé

## Monthly Challenges

Monthly Challenge: Every month, we challenge you to create something creative, unique, or even weird as you naviagte or learn a new technology or software. Plus, you can even earn a prize or two. 

This month, we have a Personal Portfolio challenge...

## On-Platform Community

## The Community Discord
![](https://i.imgur.com/6hFm9Dc.jpeg)
Join the HUNDREDS of students on our Discord channel. Just like a CS class, we have specific help channels that you can pop into to ask questions about certain concepts or topics! 

## GitHub Student Developer Pack

Are you a a current college student with a **.edu** email? You have **FREE** club access for 6 months!!! YES. We‚Äôll cover your first semester of Cod√©dex. üòé

so you can still get the Cod√©dex ‚ú® experience ‚ú® to help you better understand more advanced topics. 

These + *all the [CLUB perks](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) are 

## Conclusion! 

While these are some of the main resources we have for students, our content is never ending. We're constantly updating our catalog of courses to help students like you reach their goals in passing their classes and learning new things!
