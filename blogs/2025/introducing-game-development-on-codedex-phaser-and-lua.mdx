## Game Development Comes to Codédex

![image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fintroducing-game-development-on-codedex-phaser-and-lua%2Fcomments.png?alt=media&token=1fb47418-5547-4c81-bdea-c0fc1522f51d)

You asked, we listened. Game Development has been one of the most requested topics from the Codédex community – and we’re thrilled to finally make it happen!

The Curriculum team at Codédex has been quietly building behind the scenes, and today, we’re proud to announce two brand new game dev courses:

- 🕹️ **[Phaser](https://codedex.io/phaser)** (JavaScript)
- 🌙 **[Lua](https://codedex.io/lua)** (LÖVE + Roblox Studio)

Whether you want to build a pixel-perfect browser game or bring your own Roblox world to life, these courses are the perfect place to start for aspiring game devs and modders.

## Phaser: Build Web Games That Run Anywhere

![Phaser course](https://i.imgur.com/2gb7Epq.gif)

**Phaser** is a popular JavaScript framework designed specifically for making 2D (and even 3D!) **web games** that run right in the browser. No downloads, no installs. Just instant fun.

You can embed your creations on a website, share them with friends and family, or publish them on platforms like [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/made-with-phaser) and Codédex's Project Showcase! 

### 🔑 Key Features

Phaser provides built-in physics, animations, keyboard and touch controls, and audio support... everything you need to make your ideas playable fast. Its physics engine supports collision, motion, and gravity, while the sprite system makes it easy to create and animate game objects.

In a few lines of code, you can build a game scene, move sprites around, and add player controls! 🎯

### 👾 Our Phaser Course

Ready to bring your JavaScript skills to life? Our free Phaser course is packed with hands-on exercises, fun projects, and pre-made spritesheets to help you start building games fast. No game dev experience needed. Just a bit of JavaScript know-how and your imagination. ✨

Course Chapters:

1. **Your First Quest** - Set up Phaser and make something playable in minutes.
2. **Sprites, Sprites, Sprites!** - Learn how to bring characters to life with animations.
3. **Triple Jump** - Add physics, jumping mechanics, and controls to make your game feel just right.
4. **Coming Soon** - A brand new chapter is on the way. 👀

By the end of this course, you’ll have your own web game you can share with friends and family. 🚀

## Lua

![Lua course](https://i.imgur.com/8NKD7Ej.gif)

[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a lighweight, beginner-friendly, scripting language syntactically similar to Python. 

If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3, World of Warcraft, or Balatro (2025 Game of the Year) – you’ve already seen Lua in action. It integrates seamlessly with LÖVE, an open-source framework for 2D game development, and powers the scripting inside Roblox Studio through a special version called Luau.

### 🔑 Key Features

![image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fintroducing-game-development-on-codedex-phaser-and-lua%2Froblox-studio.png?alt=media&token=aa682fa8-6765-4c31-91da-32e157b1c4b2)

Lua is fast, flexible, and incredibly easy to learn, perfect for beginners. It’s great for quickly prototyping 2D games or customizing your favorite titles.

And with LÖVE and Roblox Studio, you can go from writing your first line of code to seeing your own world come alive in no time.

It can also be used to create embedded systems, web servers, and developer tools, but for our purposes, we're focusing on game development.

### 👾 Our Lua Course

Say Olá to Lua! Our free Lua course will take you from your very first `print("Hello, world!")` to building full game systems with logic and structure. It's an accelerated course so you should know one general purpose programming language (Python, Java, or C++) before taking this.

Course Chapters:

1. **Olá, Lua** - Get to know Lua’s syntax, variables, and make the computer talk back to you.
2. **Control Flow and Loops** - Learn how to make the code think for itself with conditionals and loops.
3. **Tables and Functions** - There's just one data structure in Lua (Tables) so it's an essential.
4. **Objects** - Dive into Lua’s object system to start structuring your own game logic.

By the end of this course, you’ll understand why Lua powers so many of your favorite games and you’ll be ready to start scripting your own adventures. 💫

## 🗓️ Upcoming Events

We have a few upcoming game development events in November and December!

### Lua Workshop

Join me on **Wednesday, November 12 at 3PM ET** for a live Lua workshop!

We’ll be walking through a section of the new course, code-along style — so bring your curiosity and your keyboard.

### Game Jam

Keep your eyes peeled for our first Codédex Game Jam, happening this ecember! It’s your chance to team up with other Codédex creators, show off your new Phaser or Lua skills, and build something amazing together.

## GLHF

Game development is one of the most creative, rewarding ways to learn to code — and now you can do it right here on Codédex.

We will share our favorites in Project Showcase's [(Game)](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/game) tag.

Happy coding! We can't wait to see what you create. 🕹️
