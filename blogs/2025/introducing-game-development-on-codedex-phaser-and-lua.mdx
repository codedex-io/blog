## Game Development Comes to Codédex

![image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fintroducing-game-development-on-codedex-phaser-and-lua%2Fcomments.png?alt=media&token=1fb47418-5547-4c81-bdea-c0fc1522f51d)

You asked, we listened. Game Development has been one of the most requested topics from the Codédex community – and we’re thrilled to finally make it happen!

The Curriculum team at Codédex has been quietly building behind the scenes, and today, we’re proud to announce two brand new game dev courses:

- 🕹️ **[Phaser](https://codedex.io/phaser)** (JavaScript)
- 🌙 **[Lua](https://codedex.io/lua)** (LÖVE + Roblox Studio)

Whether you want to build a pixel-perfect browser game or bring your own Roblox world to life, these courses are the perfect place to start.

## Phaser: Build Web Games That Run Anywhere

![Phaser course](https://i.imgur.com/2gb7Epq.gif)

**Phaser** is a popular JavaScript framework designed specifically for making 2D (and even 3D!) web games that run right in the browser. No downloads, no installs. Just instant fun.

You can embed your creations on a website, share them with friends, or publish them on platforms like [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/made-with-phaser)!

### 🔑 Key Features

Phaser provides built-in physics, animations, keyboard and touch controls, and audio support... everything you need to make your ideas playable fast. Its physics engine supports collision, motion, and gravity, while the sprite system makes it easy to create and animate game objects.

In just a few lines of code, you can build a full game scene, move sprites around, and add player controls! 🎯

### 👾 Our Phaser Course

Ready to bring your JavaScript skills to life? Our free Phaser course is packed with hands-on exercises, fun projects, and pre-made spritesheets to help you start building games fast. No game dev experience needed. Just a bit of JavaScript know-how and your imagination. ✨

Course Chapters:

1. **Your First Quest** - Set up Phaser, create your first game scene, and make something playable in minutes.
2. **Sprites, Sprites, Sprites!** - Learn how to bring characters and objects to life with animations.
3. **Triple Jump** — Add physics, jumping mechanics, and smooth controls to make your game feel just right.
4. Coming Soon... — A brand new chapter is on the way. 👀

By the end of this course, you’ll have your own web game you can share with your friends and family. 🚀

## Lua

![Lua course](https://i.imgur.com/8NKD7Ej.gif)

[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a lighweight, beginner-friendly, scripting language syntactically similar to Python. 

If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3, World of Warcraft, or Balatro (2025 Game of the Year) — you’ve already seen Lua in action.

Lua integrates seamlessly with LÖVE, an open-source framework for 2D game development, and powers the scripting inside Roblox Studio through a special version called Luau.

### 🔑 Key Features

![image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fintroducing-game-development-on-codedex-phaser-and-lua%2Froblox-studio.png?alt=media&token=aa682fa8-6765-4c31-91da-32e157b1c4b2)

Lua is known for its simplicity and lightweight design, making it easy to learn for beginners,  aspiring game devs or modders. Lua was made to integrate seamlessly with existing game engines and frameworks, allowing developers to extend functionality or create entirely new games from scratch! It can also be used to create embedded systems, web servers, and developer tools, but for our purposes, we're focusing on game development.

With Lua and LÖVE, you can quickly prototype and build 2D games with minimal setup. Lua's straightforward syntax makes it accessible for those new to game development. 

### 👾 Our Phaser Course

Say Olá to Lua — a lightweight scripting language loved by indie devs, modders, and Roblox creators alike. Our free Lua course will take you from your very first `print("Hello, world!")` to building full game systems with logic and structure.

No fancy setup required — just your browser and curiosity. 🌙

Course Chapters:

1. **Olá, Lua** — Get to know Lua’s syntax, variables, and how to make the computer talk back to you.
2. **Control Flow and Loops** — Learn how to make your code think for itself with conditionals and loops.
3. **Tables and Functions** — Master the building blocks of Lua programs and keep your code organized.
4. **Objects** — Dive into Lua’s object system to start structuring your own game logic.

By the end, you’ll understand why Lua powers so many of your favorite games and you’ll be ready to start scripting your own adventures. 💫

## GLHF

Game development is one of the most creative, rewarding ways to learn to code — and now you can do it right here on Codédex.

We will share our favorites in Project Showcase's [(Game)](https://www.codedex.io/community/project-showcase/game) tag.

Happy coding! We can't wait to see what you create. 🕹️
