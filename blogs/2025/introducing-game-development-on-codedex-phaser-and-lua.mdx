## Game Development Comes to Codédex

![image](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fintroducing-game-development-on-codedex-phaser-and-lua%2Fcomments.png?alt=media&token=1fb47418-5547-4c81-bdea-c0fc1522f51d)

You asked, we listened. Game Development has been one of the most requested topics from the Codédex community – and we’re thrilled to finally make it happen!

The Curriculum team at Codédex have seen your comments, and we love the enthusiasm. 

We’re so excited to announce two newly released game development courses: Phaser and Lua!

## Phaser

Phaser is a popular JavaScript framework designed specifically for making 2D and 3D web games, though it's most popular for 2D. 

Games run directly in the browser and are easy to share anywhere you share web projects. You can embed games made with Phaser onto a website, or publish them somewhere like [itch.io](https://itch.io/games/made-with-phaser)!

### 🔑 Key Features

Phaser provides a set of built-in tools that streamline game development. It provides built-in physics, animations, keyboard input, and audio, so you can focus on game logic. Its physics engine supports collision detection and realistic movement, and the sprite system makes it easy to create and animate game objects.

The framework includes support for multiple input methods, including keyboard, mouse, and touch controls, making games accessible across different devices.

With just a few lines of code, you can create a game scene with sprites, handle user input, and implement game logic! 🎯

## Lua

![Lua course](https://i.imgur.com/8NKD7Ej.gif)

[Lua](https://www.lua.org/) is a scripting language syntactically similar to Python. 

It's popular for making mods for games like Baldur's Gate 3 and World of Warcraft, and parts of both games were originally written in Lua. It was also used to build the 2025 game of the year, [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/). 

It can be combined with [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), which is an open-source framework for game development. And if you're interested in making Roblox games, Roblox uses a version of Lua called Luau that integrates seamlessly with the Roblox Studio visual editor. 

### 🔑 Key Features

Lua is known for its simplicity and lightweight design, making it easy to learn for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Lua was made to integrate seamlessly with existing game engines and frameworks, allowing developers to extend functionality or create entirely new games from scratch! It can also be used to create embedded systems, web servers, and developer tools, but for our purposes, we're focusing on game development.

With Lua and LÖVE, you can quickly prototype and build 2D games with minimal setup. Lua's straightforward syntax makes it accessible for those new to game development.

## Upcoming Events

### Lua Workshop

We have a few upcoming game development events in November and December!

I'll also be hosting a Lua Workshop on Wednesday, November 12th at 3pm Eastern Time. We'll be walking through part of the Lua course, code-along style.

### Game Jam

Keep your eyes peeled for a Game Jam in December! Now's a great time to start the Phaser or Lua course so you can put your best foot forward. 

Happy coding! We can't wait to see what you make. 🎮
