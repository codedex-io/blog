Hey, Dharma here! Back with another update from the Codédex Engineering team.

This time around, let's talk avatars. 👤

## What You Can Customize

Since we launched [Codédex Worlds](https://www.codedex.io/worlds), you've been able to pick from a handful of preset characters: the boy, the girl, the bot, the cat-ear boy, and the cat-year girl. Classic.

That changes with this update.

We're excited to introduce **avatar customization** – a new way to create a character that actually represents you in Codédex Worlds.

Meet the new character customizer!

![Sprite](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fcustomize-your-avatar-in-worlds%2Fcharacter-customizer.gif?alt=media&token=406feea2-5de2-446f-be7e-b2cf1e0a1ad6)

Here's what you can personalize:

| Category     | Options                                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👱 Skin Tone    | 7 tones to match your look                                                          |
| 💇 Hair Style   | 3 styles to choose from                                                             |
| 💈 Hair Color   | 10 colors including blonde, brown, black, white, red, pink, purple, green, and blue |
| 👕 Outfit Style | 4 different outfit designs                                                          |
| 🎨 Outfit Color | 5 colors per outfit style                                                           |
| 🖼️ Background   | Custom preview background                                                           |

Mix and match to create hundreds of unique combinations. Want pink hair with a green outfit? Go for it. Prefer something more classic with the default colors? That works too.

Of course, your avatar automatically gets saved to your account, so you’ll look the same every time you enter Worlds and in the dashboard and other places.

<Quote text="For a 144×96 walking spritesheet, that's 13,824 pixels to check. Multiply this number with 5 which is the number of color shades and that results in ~69,000 comparisons. And, it happens instantly!" />

## The Engineering Challenge

Building a customization system sounds simple: 1) add the outfit/hair style, 2) pick a color, 3) apply it to the sprite and boom! Done, right?

Well, not quite. Here’s what I had to consider:

**Static Assets Combination** - 7 skin tones, 3 hair styles with 10 hair colors, 4 outfits with 5 different colors for each outfit and 8 background colors. The number of combinations is 7 \* 3 \* 10 \* 4 \* 5 \* 8 = 33600 combinations! Creating a separate sprite file for each? That’s over 33600 asset files for \*one\* character, across walking and standing animations in 4 directions. NO THANKS! 

**Preserving pixel-art depth** – You can't just find-and-replace colors. A sprite has shadows, mid-tones, and highlights. Swap "brown" for "pink" and you lose all that shading. The character looks flat and lifeless.

**Real-time preview** – The Worlds runs in [Phaser](https://codedex.io/phaser), but the customizer lives in React outside of the Worlds. I needed instant visual feedback without booting up a game engine every time you tweak a style for your character.

**Layer synchronization** – Body, hair, and outfit are separate sprite layers. They all need to animate together, frame-perfectly, in all four directions. Imagine a game world where your character walks and the hair comes floating behind it. Yeah, I wouldn’t play that game either!

So what did I do to address these issues, you ask? Let’s take a look!

## The Solution

It starts with understanding the spritesheet.

### Anatomy of a Spritesheet

Each character is a 24x24 pixel sprite arranged in a grid. Similiary each asset such as hair type, outfit type, etc. is a similar spritesheet.

There are two variant spritesheets of each asset. One for idle standing animation and one for walking animation. Take a look at this base body idle standing spritesheet:

![spritesheet](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fcustomize-your-avatar-in-worlds%2Fbody-idle.png?alt=media&token=735a8e3c-fb19-40fa-ad2d-6897b748e097)

It has 10 frames in each row. A total of 40 frames.

Here's the JavaScript code:

```js
// Standing/idle: 10 frames × 4 directions = 40 frames
const standingSpritesheet = {
  frameWidth: 24,
  frameHeight: 24,
  columns: 10,
  rows: 4,
};

// Walking animation: 6 frames × 4 directions = 24 total frames
const walkingSpritesheet = {
  frameWidth: 24,
  frameHeight: 24,
  columns: 6, // Animation frames
  rows: 4, // Down, Right, Left, Up
};

// That's 64 frames per layer, per character.
// Now multiply by hair, body, outfit layers...
```

### The Multi-Shade Palette System

Here's the key insight: a "color" isn't one color – it's a coordinated palette of shades.

![color mappings](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/codedex-io.appspot.com/o/blogs%2Fcustomize-your-avatar-in-worlds%2Fcolors.png?alt=media&token=1c262911-ee9a-41c2-af2f-53bf18762642)

Each shade maps to specific pixels in the sprite. The dark base creates depth around edges, mid-tones fill the bulk, and highlights add that pixel-art pop.

Shoutout to our brilliant pixel artist Azuna for handcrafting these assets and our in-house in-house Sr. Product Designer Jackie Liu for the color palettes!

### Pixel-by-Pixel Color Swapping

Here's where the magic happens. We literally scan every pixel:

```js
function recolorImageData(imageData: ImageData, colorMap: Map<string, RGBA>) {
  const buffer = imageData.data; // Raw RGBA pixel array
  const tolerance = 15; // Forgiveness for compression tolerance

  // Loop through every pixel (4 values each: R, G, B, A)
  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length; i += 4) {
    const r = buffer[i];
    const g = buffer[i + 1];
    const b = buffer[i + 2];
    const a = buffer[i + 3];

    // Skip transparent pixels (nothing to recolor)
    if (a === 0) continue;

    // Find if this pixel matches any source color
    for (const [sourceColor, targetColor] of colorMap) {
      const distance =
        Math.abs(r - sourceColor[0]) +
        Math.abs(g - sourceColor[1]) +
        Math.abs(b - sourceColor[2]);

      if (distance <= tolerance) {
        // Swap the pixel to the new color!
        buffer[i] = targetColor[0]; // R
        buffer[i + 1] = targetColor[1]; // G
        buffer[i + 2] = targetColor[2]; // B
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a 144×96 walking spritesheet, that's 13,824 pixels to check. Multiply this number with 5 which is the number of color shades and that results in \~69,000 comparisons. 

And, it happens instantly!

**Note**: "Compression tolerance" refers to small color shifts that happen when images are saved or compressed. A pixel that should be exactly #341300 might become #351401. The tolerance = 15 means: if a pixel is close enough to the target color (within 15 units), we still consider it a match and swap it. 

This would often happen in production environment when it doesn't happen on local development environments because of all the optimizations that production is streamlined with.

Of course, that’s not all. We also handle shading relationships using color luminance with the “Human eye perception” formula. So, when the original sprite has a dark brown shadow pixel, your pink version gets an equivalent dark pink shadow. The depth is preserved.

So when the original sprite has a dark brown shadow pixel, your pink version gets an equivalently dark pink shadow. The depth is preserved.

### Layer Compositing

Finally, we stack the layers like transparent overlays:

```js
// Sort layers by z-index and draw them in order
const layerCanvases = [
  bodyCanvas, // zIndex: 0 – base layer
  hairCanvas, // zIndex: 1 – on top
  outfitCanvas, // zIndex: 2 – topmost details
];

layerCanvases.forEach((layer) => {
  ctx.drawImage(layer, 0, 0); // Each layer composites onto the previous
});

// Register the final composite with Phaser's texture manager
scene.textures.addSpriteSheet(uniqueKey, compositeCanvas, {
  frameWidth: 24,
  frameHeight: 24,
});
```

The result gets a unique key based on your exact configuration, so the same pink-hair-green-outfit combo is shared across all players who chose it. Gotta be efficient after all, right?

This also makes sure that the layers are never out of sync when rendered. So, no “hair floating behind the character” or “outfit floating above the character” moments! 

### Real-Time Preview (Without the Game Engine)

As stated, the customizer runs in React, but the avatars render in Phaser(our game engine). We can’t boot up a whole game just to show a preview.

Solution? A parallel rendering system:

```js
// Load the spritesheet as a regular image
async function loadImage(src: string): Promise<HTMLImageElement> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.crossOrigin = "anonymous";
    img.onload = () => resolve(img);
    img.onerror = reject;
    img.src = src;
  });
}

// Extract just one frame from the spritesheet for preview
ctx.drawImage(
  image,
  frameWidth, // Start at 2nd frame (facing forward)
  0,
  frameWidth,
  frameHeight,
  0,
  0,
  frameWidth,
  frameHeight,
);
```

We grab the standing-facing-forward frame, apply the same palette swapping logic, composite the layers, and export it:

```js
export async function generateAvatarPreview(config: AvatarConfig) {
  // ... load and composite all layers ...

  // Export as a data URL for instant display
  return finalCanvas.toDataURL("image/png");

  // Result: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo..."
  // Displays instantly in an <img> tag!
}
```

Same color math, same layer stacking – just without Phaser. When you tweak your hair color, you see the result in milliseconds.

**The payoff?** Hundreds of unique combinations from ~20 base sprite files. No 10,000-asset nightmare. Just math, pixels, and a lot of for-loops running twice – once for your preview, once in the game.

## Why This Matters

Worlds is where our community comes together – for events, hackathons (raffles and winner announcements), and just hanging out. But when everyone looks the same, it's hard to feel like **you**.

Now you can stand out. Express yourself. And when you spot that bright pink hair across the room, you'll know exactly who it is.

P.S. This is just the beginning. More customization options are in the works. Stay tuned.

Happy coding,
Dharma
