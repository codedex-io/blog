Your resume is your first impression with potential employers, and you want it to be a good one! Treat them as your personal pitch deck; something to show off your accomplishments and tell them that you will be a valuable asset to their company. 

There’s so much advice out there on what you should and shouldn’t include in your resume. Below I breakdown all of the strategies that can make or break a great resume. Keep in mind that this guideline applies mainly to U.S. resumes. Other countries may have some slightly different expectations, like including a photo. 

## Formatting Your Resume

On average, hiring managers and recruiters only look at a resume for 6-8 seconds. That means you want your resume to LOOK great before they even read anything. Plus, those pesky AI Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) don’t like those fancy layouts. 

Here is what you should pay attention to when formatting your resume:

**Length:** Most resumes should be 1 page, with no more than 2 if you have extensive experience.

**Fonts:** Keep fonts simple like Calibri, Helvetica, or Arial with a font size of 10-12 px. Text color should also always be black.

**Structure:**

- Personal Information
  - First and Last name
  - Professional email address 
    - ❌ catlover85@hotmail.com
    - ✅ johnsmith@gmail.com
  - Phone Number
  - City & State (no need for full address)
  - LinkedIn, GitHub, Portfolio, or Personal website link
- Summary
- Education
- Experience
- Projects
- Certifications
- Skills

**Text:** Most text should be written in bullet points, such as your work experience or projects.

**File Naming:** Save the file as a PDF and give it a name like firstname_lastname_resume.pdf

## Sell Your Work

A great resume isn’t just about telling employers what you did, it is also showing how well you did it. Try to focus on your accomplishments, not just what the job or project specifications were. Use metrics and strong writing to really drive home the point that you are an asset. 

Here’s how you can do that: 

**Focus on impact:** Show how your work positively impacted the business. For example:
- ❌ “Created new email onboarding automation.”
- ✅ “Increased user retention by 20% through new email onboarding automation.”

**Quantify Results:** Use metrics whenever possible! Show percentages, revenue growth, user growth, or something like time saved that can be attributed to your work. 


**Use Strong Verbs:** Use verbs like “Automated, Build, Designed, Led, Developed, ect” to energize what you accomplished. Some examples are:
- “Led redesign of email onboarding automation that increased user retention by 20%”
- “Automated repetitive tasks using Python, saving 5+ hours per week.”
- “Improved web page loading times by 2 seconds by minimizing JavaScript, decreasing bounce rates by 15%”

**Plug in Job Description Keywords:** Identify the keywords in the job description and put them to use in your resume. Hiring Managers and ATS bots scan your resume for some specific words that match the job listing. Make sure to add the keywords organically and don’t stuff them into places it may not be a great fit (it may sound like an AI wrote your resume). 

## Skills and Certifications

Many people often overlook their skills and certifications portion of their resume. Instead, it can be used to really showcase your proficiencies that match the job description. 

Here, you should place your technical and soft skills that are related to the job. The skills section is also the perfect place to use some keywords that will please ATS bots.

Certificates can be a great addition to your resume. Certifications from Google, AWS, Meta, Microsoft Azure, etc, can really help you stand out. In some cases, a certification may be a requirement for a job, so being ahead of the game can prove to be a real benefit to you.

## “What if I don’t have experience?”

In the event that you don’t have any experience (or relevant experience), here are some things you can make sure to have on your resume: 

- Personal projects (related to job description)
- Related course work
- Club/volunteer/tech community involvement
  - Do you attend IRL coding meetups?
  - Were you president or your high school CS Club?
  - Do you participate in Codédex’s annual hackathon?
- Internships
- A strong skills section
- Certifications

## Conclusion

Outside of the above guide, the most important part to a resume is REVIEWING IT. You don’t want to already have some negative remarks against you because of a silly spelling/grammatical error. Triple check it yourself or even ask a friend or 
your favorite AI to point out any mistakes! Writing a resume may seem like a scary task, but following this guide will help you get on the right track to giving your resume the glow-up you’re looking for.
