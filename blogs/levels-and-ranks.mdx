We are thrilled to unveil a significant update to CodÃ©dex today! (ãƒŽ ^o^)ãƒŽå½¡â˜†

After listening to your feedback and working tirelessly behind the scenes, we are proud to present our brand new **Levels and Ranking** system. This adds a whole new dimension to your learning experience. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, get ready to embark on an unforgettable coding adventure like never before! ðŸš€

## Levels

There are now 25 player levels on CodÃ©dex, from level 1 to level 25. 

Everyone starts at level 1. You must gain experience points (XP) by completing course exercises, code challenges, and other on-platform activities (coming soon) to level up. The more you learn and practice, the higher your level will soar!

Alongside leveling up, you'll also unlock a series of achievements and special rewards. These could range from exclusive access to the community, in-game items, and more.

## Ranks

Your level determines your rank. Each rank has a name and badge icon representing your overall programming proficiency and rizzing up your profile.

The five ranks in CodÃ©dex are:

- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_1.png" height="25" alt="Bronze Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Bronze (Level 1-5)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_2.png" height="25" alt="Silver Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Silver (Level 6-10)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_3.png" height="25" alt="Gold Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Gold (Level 11-15)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_4.png" height="25" alt="Diamond Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Diamond (Level 16-20)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_5.png" height="25" alt="Platinum Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Platinum (Level 21-25)</span>

Most CodÃ©dex learners will find themselves in the introductory ranks (e.g., Bronze and Silver) for quite a while, which is a testament to how difficult it can be to climb rankings.

## How do I climb the ranking system?

Here's a look from level 1 to 9:

| Level | Rank   | XP to Unlock | Rewards |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ | ------- |
| Lvl 1 | Bronze | N/A          | N/A     |
| Lvl 2 | Bronze | 100 XP       | Discord |
| Lvl 3 | Bronze | 250 XP       | OPC     |
| Lvl 4 | Bronze | 500 XP       | ???     |
| Lvl 5 | Bronze | 750 XP       | ???     |
| Lvl 6 | Silver | 1000 XP      | ???     |
| Lvl 7 | Silver | 1500 XP      | ???     |
| Lvl 8 | Silver | 2000 XP      | ???     |
| Lvl 9 | Silver | 2500 XP      | ???     |

## Where do I find my level and rank?

Your current level can be found in the stats section of your user profile. For example: [www.codedex.io/@sonny](https://www.codedex.io/@sonny). Your rank is next to your profile picture in the badge form.

## How did you come up with this system?

Before ideating our own, we dug into popular EdTech platforms like Duolingo and some of our favorite games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch.

Everyone thinks about leveling differently, and so do we. After countless hours of researching and brainstorming, this system that we arrived at makes the most sense for our learner base and the neverending coding journey.

## Can my level and rank go down?

While we didn't implement any rank decay mechanisms in CodÃ©dex, your XP can decrease if you reset your course progress in Account > Settings.
