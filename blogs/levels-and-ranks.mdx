We are thrilled to unveil a significant update to Codédex today! 

After listening to your feedback and working tirelessly behind the scenes, we are proud to present our brand new Levels and Ranking system. This adds a whole new dimension to your learning experience. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, get ready to embark on an unforgettable coding adventure like never before! 🚀

#### Levels

There are now 25 player levels on Codédex, from level 1 to level 25. 

Everyone starts at level 1. You must gain experience points (XP) by completing course exercises, code challenges, and other on-platform activities (coming soon) to level up. The more you learn and practice, the higher your level will soar!

Alongside leveling up, you'll also unlock a series of achievements and special rewards. These could range from exclusive access to the community, in-game items, and more. 😱

#### Ranks

Your level determines your rank. Each rank has a name and badge icon representing your overall programming proficiency and rizzing up your profile.

The five ranks in Codédex are:

- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_1.png" height="25" alt="Bronze Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Bronze (Level 1-5)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_2.png" height="25" alt="Silver Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Silver (Level 6-10)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_3.png" height="25" alt="Gold Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Gold (Level 11-15)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_4.png" height="25" alt="Diamond Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Diamond (Level 16-20)</span>
- <span style={{display: "flex", position: "relative", top: "6px"}}><img src="https://www.codedex.io/images/rank_badges/level_5.png" height="25" alt="Platinum Badge" style={{marginRight: "5px"}}/> Platinum (Level 21-25)</span>

Most Codédex learners will find themselves in the introductory ranks (e.g., Bronze and Silver) for quite a while, which is a testament to how difficult it can be to climb rankings.

#### How do I climb the ranking system?

Here's a from level 1 to 6:

<div className="nes-table-responsive work-sans">
  <table className="nes-table is-bordered is-centered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Level</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
        <th>XP to Unlock</th>
        <th>Rewards</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 1</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 2</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>100 XP</td>
        <td>Discord</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 3</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>500 XP</td>
        <td>???</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 4</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>1000 XP</td>
        <td>???</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 5</td>
        <td>Bronze</td>
        <td>1500 XP</td>
        <td>???</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lvl 6</td>
        <td>Silver</td>
        <td>2000 XP</td>
        <td>???</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

#### Where do I find my level and rank?

Your current level can be found in the stats section of your user profile. For example: [www.codedex.io/@sonny](https://www.codedex.io/@sonny).

Your rank is next to your profile picture in the badge form.

#### How did you come up with this system?

Before ideating our own, we dug into popular EdTech platforms like Duolingo and some of our favorite games, such as Dota 2, League of Legends, and Overwatch.

Everyone thinks about leveling differently, and so do we. After countless hours of researching and brainstorming, this system that we arrived at makes the most sense for our learner base and the neverending coding journey.

#### Can my level and rank go down?

While we didn't implement any rank decay mechanisms in Codédex, your XP can decrease if you reset your course progress in Account > Settings.
