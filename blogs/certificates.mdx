We’ve been listening closely to your feedback and are thrilled to announce that Codédex now offers certificates of completion in our Python, HTML, and CSS courses! 🙌

#### Why a certificate of completion?

In the fast-paced world of tech, your skills and accomplishments deserve to be acknowledged. A certificate of completion is not just a piece of paper; it's a symbol of your commitment, perseverance, and growth. 

Whether you're a code newbie taking your first steps or an experienced developer looking to upskill, this certificate will be a testament to your journey and a powerful addition to your portfolio and LinkedIn profile.

#### What makes our certificate special?

**👤 Tailored to Your Achievements**

This certificate isn't a one-size-fits-all template. It's personalized to showcase the specific course you've completed. Whether you've delved into The Legend of Python or The Origins Trilogy, your certificate will reflect your expertise in that particular domain.

**☁️ Digital and Shareable**

Your certificate lives in the digital realm! Each certificate will have its unique ID, URL, and QR code, so you can easily share it on LinkedIn and other socials to let the world know. It's a badge of honor that can open doors to networking, collabs, and career opportunities.

**👌 Backed by Industry Experts**

Our certificates are backed by our industry-leading instructors. These pros have not only crafted the courses you've completed but have also validated your mastery of the skills covered. Their stamp of approval makes your certificate all the more valuable.

#### How do I get my certificate?

To earn your certificate, you must successfully complete an entire course along with their Checkpoint Project and Final Project reviewed by the team. 

For example, here are the steps for The Legend of Python:

- 1️⃣ Complete chapters 1-4.

- 2️⃣ Choose a Checkpoint (pick between [Area Calculator](https://www.codedex.io/python/mid-project/area-calculator), [RPS](https://www.codedex.io/python/mid-project/rock-paper-scissors), or [Terminal Adventure](https://www.codedex.io/python/mid-project/terminal-adventure-game)). Once you’ve completed your checkpoint project, share it in the **#checkpoint** Discord channel. Our team will review your submission within 2-3 business days.

- 3️⃣ Continue to complete chapters 5-8.

- 4️⃣ Dive into the [Final Project](https://www.codedex.io/python/final-project). Post your submission in the **#final-project** Discord channel for a team review.

- 5️⃣ Once you’ve completed everything, fill out [this form to request your certificate](https://59ty7awbpjd.typeform.com/to/z9b4XvIc). 

You will receive an email and a ping in the **#certificates** channel when you get it!

#### How does the project review work?

Reviews not only help you improve by getting your work in front of others, but they also help us verify course completion and assess your learnings.

- Checkpoint Project reviews consist of “✨ Glows” and “🌱 Grows” – there’s no grading system. We assume that you’ve done your best, employed your learnings, and are ready for feedback on where you did well (keep going!) and where there’s room for improvement.
- Final Project reviews usually consist of a Loom video recorded by a team member, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soJtl1ptRIA).

Happy coding!
