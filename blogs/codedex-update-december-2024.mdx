HAPPY NEW YEAR, ヾ( ˃ᴗ˂ )◞ • *✰ 

December was a happening month in the Codédex community as we hosted our [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/blog/holiday-hackathon-2024-winners), shipped a brand new user dashboard, and launched the long-awaited [Java course](https://www.codedex.io/java) (4 chapters in 4 weeks!). 

The team was able to rest and recharge for the holidays, and now we are back in the office (and on Slack, for our remote members) to kick off Q1 2025! 

Let’s get into it.

#### New User Dashboard

In November, we revamped our landing page, course page, sign-up page, and added a new onboarding quiz. In December, we updated the user dashboard. 😍

#### New Python Header

Introducing our new Python header – brought to life by our talented friend, MeeNa [@moawko](https://x.com/moawko). This art piece is the first of five upcoming headers designed to worldbuild, shape our lore, and further differentiate our brand. Stay tuned for more!
