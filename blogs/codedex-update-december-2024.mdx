HAPPY NEW YEAR, ヾ( ˃ᴗ˂ )◞ • *✰ 

December was a happening month in the Codédex community as we hosted our [Mini Holiday Hackathon](https://www.codedex.io/blog/holiday-hackathon-2024-winners), shipped a brand new user dashboard, and launched the long-awaited [Java course](https://www.codedex.io/java) (4 chapters in 4 weeks!). 

The team was able to rest and recharge for the holidays, and now we are back in the office (and on Slack, for our remote members) to kick off 2025! 

Let’s get into it.

#### New User Dashboard

In November, we revamped our landing page, course page, sign-up page, and added a new onboarding quiz. In December, we updated the user dashboard. 😍

#### World Building & Lore
