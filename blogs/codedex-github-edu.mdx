Exciting news! Codédex is now part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.codedex.io/github-students)!!! 🥳

#### Spill the tea! What does this mean for me?

If you are a verified student through GitHub Education, you can receive 6 months of [Codédex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) — a premium membership — for FREE!

With a Codédex Club membership, you’ll gain access to:

- 🌈 Full content catalog: The Legend of Python, Origins Trilogy, and more
- ➕ Bonus Articles & Cheat Sheets as supplemental material
- 🎴 Challenge Packs (think LeetCode!)
- 🚀 Checkpoint and Final Projects 
- 📜 Course Certificates
- 🗓️ Exclusive invites to community events

#### Why we partnered with GitHub Education

TL;DR is that it made sense! This is a dream collab. 😇

The longer story: Much like GitHub’s mission statement to “help every developer — regardless of experience — learn, code and ship software effectively,” Codédex is on a mission to level up the next wave of builders. We’re firm believers that every aspiring developer needs a strong foundation that’s accessible both in price and approach. 

We’re thrilled to be part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and offer a 6-month Codédex Club membership to help YOU get started!

And if we’re really being honest on why we partnered with GitHub, it’s a full circle moment for our small but mighty team — we love GitHub and use it every day! <3

#### Why Codédex's great for students

Your CS professor will likely bore you, but we won’t. Our team promises to deliver fun and accessible content on the most popular programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

We’ve designed our curriculum so that you’ll gain a strong foundation in coding fundamentals and that will help you put into practice what you last learned. At the end of each course, you’ll bring it full circle with a real-world project. Along the way, you’ll unlock bonus articles and cheat sheets that supplement what you learn in each chapter.

And did I mention community?! We have a robust community on our platform & in Discord. Weekly, we host fun events such as Office Hours, Project Show & Tell, tech workshops ([Basic Debugging](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207038533907517440) & [Getting Started with GitHub](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207055343331442688) coming up!), Watch Parties, and more.

#### Wait! Do I qualify for this?

To qualify for student benefits, you must:

- Have a GitHub account.
- Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma granting course of study from a recognized educational institution.
- Be able to provide documentation from your school that shows your student status.

#### Get started w GitHub Student Developer Pack

If you are already verified via GitHub Education, go to the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to find the Codédex tile (scroll all the way down).

If you are NOT already verified via GitHub Education, follow these steps:

1. Head over to [Codédex 🤝 GitHub Education](https://www.codedex.io/github-students) page.
2. Click on the [Sign up with GitHub] button.
3. If you don't have your GitHub student account connected to your Codédex account, go to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) > [Sign up for Student Developer Pack] button.

5. Once you’ve uploaded your academic status docs on the following page and submitted them, it will take anywhere from 1 hour to 9 days for GitHub to verify you as a student.

Welcome to the Club! Once you have a Club membership, you should see a rainbow CLUB logo appear in your User Dashboard.

Hope you enjoy this partnership, and make sure to tell all your CS friends!
