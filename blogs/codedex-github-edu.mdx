Exciting news! Codédex is now part of the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://www.codedex.io/github-students)!!! 🥳

#### Spill the tea! What does this mean for me?

If you are a verified student through GitHub Education, you can receive 6 months of [Codedex Club](https://www.codedex.io/pricing) — a premium membership — for FREE!

With a Codédex Club membership, you’ll gain access to:

- 🌈 Full content catalog: The Legend of Python, Origins Trilogy, and more
- ➕ Bonus Articles & Cheat Sheets as supplemental material
- 🎴 Challenge Packs (think LeetCode!)
- 🚀 Checkpoint and Final Projects 
- 📜 Course Certificates
- 🗓️ Exclusive invites to community events

#### Why we partnered with GitHub Education

The TL;DR is that it made sense! This is a dream collab!

The longer story: Much like GitHub’s mission statement to “help every developer — regardless of experience — learn, code and ship software effectively,” Codédex is on a mission to level up the next wave of builders! We’re firm believers that every aspiring developer needs a strong foundation that’s accessible both in price and approach. 

We’re thrilled to be part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack and offer a 6-month Codédex Club membership to help YOU get started!

And if we’re really being honest on why we partnered with GitHub, it’s a full circle moment for our small-but-mighty team — we love GitHub and use it every day! 💖

#### Why Codédex's great for students

Your CS professor will likely bore you, but we won’t. Our team promises to deliver fun & accessible content on the most popular programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

We’ve designed our curriculum so that you’ll gain a strong foundation in coding fundamentals and that will help you put into practice what you last learned. At the end of each course, you’ll bring it full circle with a real-world project. Along the way, you’ll unlock bonus articles and cheat sheets that’ll supplement what you learn in each of the chapters.

And did I mention Community?! We have a robust community on our platform & in Discord. Weekly, we host fun events such as: Office Hours, Project Show & Tell, tech workshops ([Basic Debugging](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207038533907517440) & [Getting Started with GitHub](https://discord.gg/VAtARArQ?event=1207055343331442688) coming up!), Watch Parties, and more.

#### Get started w GitHub Student Developer Pack

If you are already verified via GitHub Education, simply go to the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to find the Codédex tile (scroll all the way down).

If you are NOT already verified via GitHub Education, follow the below steps:

1. Hader over to [Codédex 🤝 GitHub Education](https://www.codedex.io/github-students) page.
2. Click on the [Sign up with GitHub] button.
3. If you don't have your GitHub student account connected to your Codédex account, go to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) > [Sign up for Student Developer Pack] button.
4. Complete the application with your .edu email and/or upload proof of academic status.
5. Once you’ve uploaded your academic status docs on the following page and submit them, it will take anywhere from 1 hour to 9 days for GitHub to verify you as a student.

Welcome to the Club! Once you have a Club membership, you should see a rainbow CLUB logo appear in your User Dashboard, as well as in your Account > Settings.

Hope you enjoy this partnership and make sure to tell all your CS friends!

Happy coding! ⋆˙⟡
